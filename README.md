The Diplomatic Correspondence of Thomas Bodley

This repo contains the data associated with the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters project "The Diplomatic Correspondence of Thomas Bodley".

It is comparatively rare for humanities research data to be made open access and we would love to know more about how people use it: if you make use of this data, do please contact us at livesandletters@gmail.com to let us know about it!
