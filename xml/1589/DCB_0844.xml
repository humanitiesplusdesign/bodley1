<newline/>
intention, as touching those general Articles w
<super id="0051" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
<newline/>
were sent unto them by their Deputies: and I have
<newline/>
moved them further, aswell by writing, as by worde

of mouth, to suche effect as yo
<super id="0057" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 LL. willed, and
<newline/>
may appeere by the Copie heereinclosed, about 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
enlarging of their Deputies Commission, and also
<newline/>
for encreasing their number, if they should thinke
<newline/>
it so expedient. The Generall Articles were not
<newline/>
sent unto me in Frenche, as they were delivered to
<newline/>
the Deputies: and therfore I thought best to referre
<newline/>
them to those, whiche 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Deputies had already re-
<newline/>
ceaved, lest 
<image name="thorn"/>
e difference of translations should
<newline/>
minister occasion of some scruple. In their

 in Autenticall

forme, as sent unto them expressely from her Ma
<super id="0088" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
they might not otherwise accept them. where-
<newline/>
uppon I signified againe, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Autenticall copie
<newline/>
was in Englishe; and so sent unto me: but their
<newline/>
Deputies had receaved them in Frenche, whereto I
<newline/>
was 
<image name="thorn"/>
e willinger to referre them for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e avoiding of
<newline/>
all ambiguitie in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e diversitie of translations.
<newline/>
Nevertheles because they required to have them so
<newline/>
directly from me, I sent for those, whiche for the
<newline/>
more assurance I had in a readines translated;
<newline/>
and delivered them presently: of w

to knowe her Ma

 determination concerning 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>

<newline/>
which was to be perfourmed 
<image name="thorn"/>
e first of June.
<newline/>
And lastly they required to understand whether
<newline/>
her Ma
<super id="0153" replace="jestie">

</super>
 would be pleased to disavowe by some
<newline/>
publicke declaration the mutinous practises of all

in

courses to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e good and benefitte of these contreis.
<newline/>
As touching these particular demandes I lett them
<newline/>
understand, that I had no charge from her Ma
<super id="0170" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
to signifie any thing unto them, Howbeit I did
<newline/>
not dout but of themselves they did consider
<newline/>
that although her Ma
<super id="0176" replace="jestie">

</super>
 had promised of late, to fi-
<newline/>
nishe all accountes, and to send hither some person
<newline/>
of honorable q

litie, w
<super id="0184" replace="ith">

 full satisfaction to their other

demaundes: yet 
<image name="thorn"/>
e c
<overline id="0189" replace="om">
o
</overline>
ming of their Deputies into
<newline/>
England, did minister just occasion, to surcease from
<newline/>
that course. For considering 
<image name="thorn"/>
e manifold disorders
<newline/>
and daungers wherto their state was reduced, her
<newline/>
Ma
<super id="0197" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 could not but conceave, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at their Deputies
<newline/>
should have bin sufficiently autorised for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e refor-
<newline/>
mation of whatsoever was requisit. But finding
<newline/>
it otherwise, and knowing 
<image name="thorn"/>
at not only those maters
<newline/>
that were mentioned by them, but sundrie others
<newline/>
<folioref id="0208">

</folioref>
 of speciall moment, aswell in regard of her Ma
<super id="0211" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
as of them, required to be treated of, she thought
<newline/>
that no determination could be better, seing their
<newline/>
deputies were already in place, then to proceede
<newline/>
in suche order, as I had proposed from her Hig
<super id="0218" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
<newline/>
unto them, and was to require in that behalf their
<newline/>
speedy resoluc
<overline id="0223" replace="io">
o
</overline>
n. Wherunto they replied, that
<newline/>
they would consider uppon it, and take suche order
<newline/>
as their state would permitte. I thinke
<newline/>
they are purposed to impart 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Articles to their
<newline/>
severall Provinces: whiche can not be done w
<super id="0231" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out
<newline/>
expense of time: and for mine owne part I am
<newline/>
out of hope

 to any
<newline/>
Commission in suche ample sort, as is required, unles
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e Articles were to be treated of heere.
<newline/>
<newline/>
Besides 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Generall Articles, I have also receaved
<newline/>
those particular notes, whiche yo
<super id="0247" replace="ur">

 some persons in privat, for

<newline/>
sight of that Answear, whiche they shall deliver,
<newline/>
I will proceede as carefully as I may, and as
<newline/>
the state of thinges heere will give me leave.
<newline/>
For it fareth otherwise heere, then happely yo
