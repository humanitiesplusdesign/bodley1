For it is

<newline/>
certified hither that

full pay of all his Arrerages, and that he hath sent

<newline/>
Whatsoever is purposed, I doe finde that these men heer

are greatly perplexed for want of men and meanes:

and though heeretofore

e presumptuous conceats

 yet if

some tokens of humblenes, w

<newline/>
that they have had no answear from their Princi-

pals: whiche if they listed, and were a mater to
<newline/>
their liking, they could easely procure, and in
<newline/>
lesse then half the time. I doe very muche
<newline/>
dout heeruppon, that ether they have not, as they pro-
<newline/>
mised, sent the Articles to their Principals, or els
<newline/>
they purposely delay to call uppon them for an
<newline/>
answear. For by all that I can conjecture, these
