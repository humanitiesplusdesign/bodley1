<newline/>
The first attempt that they w

<newline/>

</super>
 they had filled a shippe, supposing
<newline/>
by it to have cast downe a great part of 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
and to have sett many houses a fire. But it pro-
<newline/>
ved in triall a weake devise, scorned at by suche as
<newline/>
stoode uppon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e walles, and that litle harme 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it did
<newline/>
fell uppon themselves. There folowed uppon it
<newline/>
a long batterie, whiche continued divers daies, and
<newline/>
some nightes, untill

to retire immediatly, finding

<image name="thorn"/>
e meanes 
<newline/>
to assault out of their boates, full of comber and

were discovered sufficiently. The cause of w

<newline/>
answear proceeded hereof. The Count not wil-
<newline/>
ling to come againe to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e assault, thought by
<newline/>
other practises, to make a division among those of
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
unto them, whiche my L. Willughby long since

gave unto

<newline/>
meaning for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e deliverie of

alteration among them. For wheras before they
<newline/>
pretended still to hold for her Ma
<super id="1008" replace="jestie">

</super>
 they began
<newline/>
then to disclame, and to use railing speeches
<newline/>
against my L. and

went about in

<newline/>
red

wrought this effect. Moreover their delivery

of my L. Willughbies Act is generally condem-

and very inconsiderat in respect of themselves.
<newline/>
For by it they excluded themselves from all

<newline/>
their allegations in excuse of this Exploit are very

frivolous and fained. They say that those of
