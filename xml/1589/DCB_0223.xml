 L. Since

e writing of my

e Enemie about

<newline/>
as they alleage, it was not possible to hold it,

be great, and suche as will turne

<newline/>
whiche is no otherwise likely. For their demaunde

<newline/>
It is nowe in consultation heere, whether it be
<newline/>
expedient or not, to send againe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Englishe
<newline/>
forces into those quarters. For it is not thought
<newline/>
that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie doth lie so strong but that
<newline/>
he may be easely repulsed. Howbeit there is
<newline/>
nothing yet resolved. There is
<newline/>
also an other newe mutinie growen in the
<newline/>

t

 violence
<newline/>
against them. Generally their govern-

ment heere hath so litle credit and countenance,

and is so altogether voide of good order, and of allthat should plant, ether feare or love in e peoples
<newline/>

<newline/>
and worthe. But before 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Contrey be redu-
<newline/>
ced to some daungerous extremitie, this gene-
<newline/>
rall discontentment will hardly breake out.
<newline/>
Whiche maketh me thinke, that if her

<newline/>
I dout at this present

lihoode, unles they be forced for feare of

<newline/>
to any alteration

<newline/>
So that for mine owne part I thinke they will
