 about

e fortifications of

Ostend,
</place>
<newline/>
I have used as muche instance, as I could, in that

<newline/>
very dilatorie. For what respect I can not cer-

tifie yo
<super id="0862" replace="ur">

</super>
 H. but as farre as I can perceave,

<newline/>
can not agree w

</super>
 those of

t
</super>
all I see there is great want

of mony on all handes. They doe also say 
<image name="thorn"/>
at the
<newline/>
daunger of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e place is more amplified in wordes,
<newline/>
then there is cause in deede. And whether besides
<newline/>
they have bin moved to attend

e returne of

their Deputies, before any resoluc
<overline id="0883" replace="io">
o

n be taken,
<newline/>
I can affirme nothing for certaine. But I have
<newline/>
found them very backward, and full of shiftes
<newline/>
and excuses in this cause, pretending 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they
<newline/>
were pressed w
<super id="0892" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 other matters of greater impor-

tance, and so putting me of from day to day.
<newline/>
Nevertheles by muche calling uppon them, I have
<newline/>
obtened at length 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they are contented to ap-
