I knowe not where to putte

I can not say for any certaintie. But, as I am per-

 letter unto

<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
time were past for Gertrudenbergh, yet I found,
<newline/>
it very requisit, to extend 
<image name="thorn"/>
e benefit of it, to other
<newline/>
good purposes. And therfore when I delivered it, I
<newline/>
declared by worde of mouth, and w
<super id="0232" replace="ith">
t
</super>
all gave it in
<newline/>

e

<newline/>
made a more exact, and an ampler declaration, for
<newline/>
divers other pointes, but that I could not doe it
<newline/>
for want of time, because it was to be done, w

e
<newline/>
breache of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Contract between them and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e garrison,
<newline/>
for that I found, it would prove a mater of dispute,
<newline/>
considering they stand uppon it, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they have per-

fourmed all that 
<image name="thorn"/>

ked to this violence, by

e dissolut proceedinges,

and contempt

not conjecture, for at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e reading of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e letter, they
<newline/>
<folioref id="0306">
fol.143r

 were all very silent, and desired time, to con-

<newline/>
troubled and abashed, as also many other through

in great feare of some soddaine siege: and their
