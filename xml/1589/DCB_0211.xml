<image name="thorn"/>
e copie, as I re-

ceaved it from them. Howbeit as I signified,
<newline/>
in my last unto yo
<super id="2048" replace="">

, their letter was sent away,
<newline/>
at

<image name="thorn"/>
e copie:
<newline/>
to

e end, no doute, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they might not be preven-
<newline/>
ted by any note or advertisment that I might
<newline/>
write uppon it from hens. I did alwaies stand
<newline/>
in dout,

at they had not sent it to their Principals,
<newline/>
whiche is nowe very easy to be seen by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e forme
<newline/>
of their Answear: as likewise for

at otherwise they
<newline/>
would have signified

<newline/>
But all their dealing is but dalliance, considering
<newline/>
they might have answeared, as they doe, a great

<newline/>
if they could obtene those first requestes, whiche
<newline/>
their letter doth mention, they will never bring the Articlesinto Treaty. In my last
