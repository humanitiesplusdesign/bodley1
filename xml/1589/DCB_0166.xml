rall and others, for desisting from the violent
<newline/>
course and proceeding lately attemptid against the Towne of Gertrudenberghe, and
<newline/>
for compounding that matter, Yet because we heare not of such good succes therin
<newline/>
as we looked for before this tyme (the importance therof being so great as it is
<newline/>
we have thought good to renew that charge unto you, And to will and c

 the disorderly proceeding

 against that said Towne by
<newline/>
reason of the rash &amp; violent attempte lately made upon the same, Wherby they have
