, nor yeat of their owne assemblie, but
<newline/>
by th'advise of some certayne, of w

<newline/>
so headdy, as far myne owne parte I can forsee no better consequ

t
<newline/>
then a daungerous alteration in the state of this gouvernment.
<newline/>
This theare are many of the cheifest hear that see, and confesse,
<newline/>
&amp; yeat suffer to go forward, every man respecting his owne
<newline/>
quiettnes and ease. I have signified amonge them as occasion
<newline/>
hath bin offered, the dislike w
<super id="2325" replace="hich">

</super>
 I thinke her 
<person id="4497" person_id="Elizabeth">

</super>

 will conceave
<newline/>
of this forceable course, consideringe they have not, as beco

ed
<newline/>
them in dutie, accquaynted her w

they have often heartofore complayned to her Ma

<newline/>
received both from her, and from her ministers, fair promisses,
<newline/>
and no effectes: but wear rather by that meanes p

their purposes. Howbeit uppon th'examination of it w
<super id="2349" replace="ith">

 her Highnes
<newline/>
in such effectuall manner, &amp; so often, as in such a cause, and in

goode correspondence it was requisite, before they had resolved
<newline/>
to use this extremitye. This the greater parte hear will acckno-
<newline/>
leadge, &amp; rather wishe that any other meanes had bin practi-

come to the question of the meanes, consideringe the unrulie
