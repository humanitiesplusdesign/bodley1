Trusty and welbelovid we greet you well. Where we have heretofore at sundrie
<newline/>
times caused the States there to understand, that we had found the keping of 
<place id="0211" place_id="Ostend">
Ostend
</place>
 to
<newline/>
be more chargable unto us, then we minded to continue, aswell for the gret decaies

of the fortificac
<overline id="0052" replace="io">

ns by breaches made by the Seas, as also by the often attempt
<image name="es"/>
<newline/>
made to beseige it, And therfore did require them to have regard thereto, and to
<newline/>
see the decaies repaired in convenient time, and to take the towne into their owne
<newline/>
charge and defence; to which motions and warning

how muche we do mislike to be thus used, in a matter of such importaunce to

is, being also an extraordinarie matter for us to mayneteyne such a towne
<newline/>
as this is, subject both to the rages of the Sea, and to the dailie attempt
