 I do very muche

ved very often, Since the
<newline/>
date of the letters. What effect wold have folowed, if they
<newline/>
had come hither in tyme, I can not saye for any certaintye,
<newline/>
But as I am 
<image name="par"/>
swaded the exclamation of the common people
<newline/>
and the instance of the counsell of estate, and of others, would
<newline/>
have forced them, To accept of Tollerable condicions: whereas
<newline/>
otherwise the chief autors of the enterprice, weare so violently
<newline/>
caryed w
<super id="0724" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 desire of revenge, as they nether wold conceave,
<newline/>
That there was Stoare of all thinges in the towne, to continewe
<newline/>
the resistance, nor thincke upon the ennemyes approchinge, whom
<newline/>
They might not attend. As by the event it fell out. as I

Signified in my last, w

 For the sight of the

<newline/>
conference uppon it, betweene the ennemy and the towne.
<newline/>
Howebeit heere is not any certaintye of any thorowe con-
<newline/>
clusion, But in generall it is reported, that the agree-
<newline/>
ment is 10 monethes pay out of hand, and 5 more  In the

 letter unto the States,
<newline/>
althoughe the tyme weare past, for 
<place id="0505" place_id="Geertruidenberg">
Geertrudenberge,
</place>
 yet
<newline/>
I found it very requisite, To extend The benefit of it,
<newline/>
To other good purposes. And therefore when I delivered it,
<newline/>
I declared by woord of mouthe, and w
<super id="0777" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 all gave it in
<newline/>
writtinge, as the custome is heere, that w
<super id="0784" replace="hich">

 I send

heere inclosed: To the ende it might be notefyed, In the

<image name="thorn"/>
at the towne should be reduced to the obedy-

<newline/>
<folioref id="0805">
fol.132v
</folioref>
 That every Deputie taketh a copy and doth send it to some of the 
<newline/>
States of his province, The States to the Burghmasters of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Townes, and the Burghmasters To the commons. I might
<newline/>
have made a more exact and ampler declaration, for
<newline/>
divers other poinct
<image name="es"/>
, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
<abbreviation id ="6727" replace="at">
t

 I could not doe it for want of

th
</super>
 the deliverye of
<newline/>
The letter. One poinct of hir Ma
<super id="0820" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 letter I have purposely
<newline/>
omitted, concerninge The breache of the contract between them
<newline/>
and the garrison, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I found, it wold prove a matter of dis-
<newline/>
pute, considering they stand upon it, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they have perfor-
<newline/>
med all that they promised, and were provoked to this
<newline/>
violence, by the dissolut proceeding
<image name="es"/>
, and contempt that was
<newline/>
used, againste them by The garrison. Howe I shall be
<newline/>
answered, I can not conjecture, for at the reading of the
<newline/>
letter, they were all very silent, &amp; desired time, to consider
<newline/>
uppon it. The principall autors are very muche troubled
<newline/>
and abashed, as also many other throwgh their indiscretion,
<newline/>
for that the discontentment of the people increaseth, as they
<newline/>
see more &amp; more the extremety of danger where into they
<newline/>
are brought. for besides The losse of Geetru
<abbreviation id="0509" replace="denberge">

 and the
<newline/>
imminent perill to the neighbo
<super id="0841" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 townes Thereabout, the
<newline/>
towne of utrecht hath sent hither in post, craving aid &amp;
<newline/>
counsell against the ennemy, whose 
<deletion id="0846">
[.]
</deletion>
 forces they fynde
<newline/>
To growe so Strong in those quarters, as they stand in
<newline/>
great feare of Some soddaine siege: and their feare is
<newline/>
The more, by reason of The factions, and disorders that
<newline/>
are among the Burghers, &amp; can not be appeased. If
<newline/>
uppon the consideration of this troblesome state your Lord
<newline/>
Should happely expect, what I would advertise to be
<newline/>
requisit, I must needes confesse, I should be greatly To
<newline/>
seeke. For  I have allwayes seene this 
<person id="0515" person_id="Council of State">
counsell of State,
</person>
<newline/>
To proceede advisedly, and very willing to interteyne
<newline/>
good correspondence w

</super>

</super>
 and likewise the most
<newline/>
<image name="par"/>
t of the deputies of the states generall, and other prin-
<newline/>
cipall persons. But as I have often Signified, 
<person id="0518" person_id="Oldenbarnvelt">
Barnevelt
</person>
<newline/>
&amp; some few besides, carie suche a hand over those of
<newline/>
Holland, by whome the rest of the provinc
<image name="es"/>
 are over ruled
<newline/>
as nothinge maye goe forward, but by his conduction. This
<newline/>
allmost all of them see and shewe their dislike very often
<newline/>
w
<super id="0875" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 many bitter speeches, and yet they take noe course
<newline/>
To redresse it: w
<super id="0879" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I can not but take for a token of god
<image name="es"/>
<newline/>
punishment towardes, when men shall be bereved of their
<newline/>
common Judgement, and discresyon, in matters of Suche
<newline/>
momente. There goethe a speeche, as if hir Ma

<newline/>
resolved to w

 the yearly loane of a somme

of mony w
<super id="0898" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 course under humble correction, I doe
<newline/>
feare very muche, if it shold be proposed, nowe that
<newline/>
this contrye, is brought to this exigent, it wold be a 
<newline/>
great occasion, to hasten their ruine. for the very name
<newline/>
of hir Ma
<super id="0906" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 protection is thought to steed them as much 
<newline/>
<folioref id="0910">
fol.133r
</folioref>
 as the assistaunce it self. And if the common people shold
<newline/>
take a conceate, that hir Hig
<super id="0914" replace="hnes">
nes

 draweth backward, I am
<newline/>
fully

swaded, they wold quickely despere, and so accord w

th
</super>
<newline/>
the ennemy To her Ma
<super id="0923" replace="ajesties">

</super>
 prejudice. On the other side,
<newline/>
if that assistaunce that is heer, shalbe still continewed,
<newline/>
it is both to slender To Supplie the necessitie of this contrey,
<newline/>
and they are growen so farre out of order in their military
<newline/>
discipline, as almost a third 
<image name="par"/>
t of the causes, that are pro-
<newline/>
posed in this counsell are complaintes against our nation.
<newline/>
For these respect
<image name="es"/>
, albeit I can not sett downe readely, what
<newline/>
remedye is best, for the preservatyon of these provinc
