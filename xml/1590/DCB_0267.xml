at

mater at first was disclosed unto me, by all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
tokens that I can see, whiche are also confir-

<newline/>
that he was holpen in nothing by

<newline/>
Howbeit I have, as of my self, this day moved

divers questions a farre of to

that place, by circ

at

reth by his answears, that he knoweth nothing

of it, but very confusely, and not to that ef-

fect, as I had proposed. This

attempt of Count Maurice being frustrat, be-

cause it may be presumed, that

will sounde and fortifie

w

 I feare to doe
