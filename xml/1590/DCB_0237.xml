signified unto them, that they can hardly

complaine in any suche cause for want of an

there was litle contened in their late letter,
<newline/>
wherunto they had not already, both from me
<newline/>
and otherwise, receaved satisfaction, as I par-
<newline/>
ticularly declared. But partly by them-

selves and partly otherwise I might perceave,
<newline/>
that they had bin charged expressly by
