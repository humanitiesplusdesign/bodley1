to passe, both

e father and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e sonne, who is also for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>

<newline/>
at sundrie times, both letters and messages to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Lady
<newline/>
Morgan (their hope to prevaile being most of all in
<newline/>
her) to dispose her affection to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e forsaid designe.
<newline/>
Especially of late, there was a messenger sent unto her,
<newline/>
who pretended somw
<super id="0641" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 els, to be 
<image name="thorn"/>

 being but of

Whiche when she had promised, after he had used those

complementes, w
<super id="0661" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 he was willed from her father, whiche
<newline/>
were full of kinde protestations of his fatherly affection,
he told her in

<image name="thorn"/>
e only thing, wherein her
<newline/>
father desired to be gratified by her, whereby she might
<newline/>
also make her self great, and doe a singular service
<newline/>
to God and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey, was to induce her husband, to

resigne his government, to

 This was presently discovered by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Lady Morgan to
<newline/>
her husband. Nevertheles she intreated him in regard
<newline/>
of her worde, to be silent in 
<image name="thorn"/>

ch

 though he promised in respect of

Moreover this being done about two moneths

bringing secretly w

<newline/>
Whereby 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Governo

</super>
 perceaving, that he was sharply
<newline/>
bent to pursue his enterprise, caused an officer to sease

upon him, and sent him hither to

e Councel. And heere
<newline/>
examined he confesseth as muche as I have signified

some ouverture, whereby

<newline/>
be wonne by surprise. For prevention wherof they
<newline/>
have had

requisit, if there could be any meanes, to provide the
