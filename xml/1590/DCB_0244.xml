The stay of my

 comming
<newline/>

 be unpleasant
<newline/>
unto me, yet unles this government may
<newline/>
be somwhat reformed, I shall finde my service
<newline/>
in this place very weerisome and comfortles.
<newline/>
The very presence of a person of nobilitie,
<newline/>
especially of him whome they desired so muche,
<newline/>
had prevailed greatly w
<super id="0071" replace="ith">

at
</super>
soever is amisse,
<newline/>
yet to reduce it for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e time to a tollerable state.
<newline/>
Whiche I am nowe out of hope to see effected

at his going into

: but was only sent
<newline/>
thither by

e

. For he had
<newline/>
no sooner founde out

<newline/>
the contents to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States of Zelande, but they
<newline/>
resolved presently, to send both him and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e letters
<newline/>
to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="5270" person_id="Philip II">
King
</person>
. Whiche was all concluded there, w

e 
<person id="5273" person_id="Council of State">
Councel
</person>
,
<newline/>
Wherat they declared by letters to be muche offended.
<newline/>
It was merveled at by some, that a man of his
<newline/>
qualitie and imploiments, would make suche an
<newline/>
errand, for whiche a letter might have served.
<newline/>
But it was considered againe, that his povertie, 
<newline/>
whiche
<newline/>
<folioref id="0125">
fol.201v
</folioref>
 is thought to be great, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e smalle reputation
<newline/>
that he lived 
<insertion id="0130">
in
</insertion>
 heere, would cause him to accept of
<newline/>
any thing, that might purchase unto him ether
<newline/>
gaine or grace. And as concerning that motion,
<newline/>
whiche he made unto 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King, I am wholy of beleefe,
<newline/>
that he was not autorised unto it, by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e General
<newline/>
States, or 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States of Zelande, nor 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it came of
<newline/>
himself: but I am rather persuaded, that since his
<newline/>
departure he hath bin written unto by 
<person id="5276" person_id="Maurice">
Count Mau-
<newline/>
rice
</person>
 and 
<person id="5279" person_id="Oldenbarnvelt">

, w
<super id="0147" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 certaine their adherents,
<newline/>
who make no dout, but if 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King would imbrace
<newline/>
that offer, they would afterwardes finde 
<image name="thorn"/>
e meanes,
<newline/>
that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e generallitie of these Provinces should con-
<newline/>
firme it willingly. I have often adverti-

</super>
 that they were
<newline/>
busied in secret, about framing 
<image name="thorn"/>
e modle of some
<newline/>
newe kinde of building. And whether it hath
<newline/>
not bin a principal occasion, that

<newline/>
of this moneth, as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e bruite went, to Congratulat
<newline/>
the victory of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 4 of Marche, but as it was se-
<newline/>
cretly then spoken, it was chiefly to make an
<newline/>
absolute offer of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Souveraignetie of these contreis
<newline/>
to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King, w
<super id="0207" replace="ith">
t

hold it from him by way of hommage. This

<folioref id="0212">
fol.202v
</folioref>
 was then 
<image name="thorn"/>
e speeceh among many: but because
<newline/>
I wanted very good autors, I knewe not howe
<newline/>
to credit it: thinking 
<image name="thorn"/>
at, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e souveraignetie of

that his privat state had suche neede, as w
