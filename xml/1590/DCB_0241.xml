</place>
 the 5
<newline/>

 should have
<newline/>
taken

at charge uppon them, but it hath bin so

e very same time, as I lastly
<newline/>
dealt w
<super id="0688" replace="ith">
t

e states. For as I have alwaies signi-
<newline/>
fied, this 
<person id="4014" person_id="Council of State">
councel of state
</person>
 hath ever complai-
<newline/>
ned of hard measure in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e General states for
<newline/>
usurping their autoritie. Howbeit they have passed
<newline/>
it w
<super id="0696" replace="ith">

 patience, till nowe that it came to so great
<newline/>
a contempt, as they might not w

t

 their credits,
<newline/>
and their othes to

<newline/>
Wherupon they made choise of a principal person,

 mine, though nether party was privy

to others allegations. And wheras they
<newline/>
object that her Ma
<super id="0724" replace="jestie">

</super>
 is ill informed, it is but
<newline/>
a bare assertion, devised only to darken and 
<newline/>
obscure an apparant mater. For if they should

meane those informations, w
