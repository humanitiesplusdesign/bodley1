farre as I can conceave, this stopping of their

 effectually, to force them unto reason, in all

that is depending between her Hig

<newline/>
For if they would be revenged, by seeking after

her cautionarie townes, it is not thought they
<newline/>
will attempt, or can, if they would, obtene a

peace to their liking. It is an opinion

heere of many, and I see some tokens of likeli-
