 H. having lately cer-
<newline/>
tified the surprise of Breda, wherof also
<newline/>
this bearer, being an eye witnes, is able to
<newline/>
deliver a more speciall report, I have only
<newline/>
to signifie, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Councell heere doth finde
<newline/>
it very necessary, to continew there in Garri-
<newline/>
son 1500 footmen, and 4 or 500 horse. And
<newline/>
because it is doubted lest 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie will give
<newline/>
some present attempt to recover 
<image name="thorn"/>
e place, there
<newline/>
is order taken for so muche provision, aswell of
<newline/>
Victuall as of powder and munition, to be caried
<newline/>
thither, as may satisfie the turne of 2000 men 
<newline/>
for a yeare: wherof 
<image name="thorn"/>
e most part is already
<newline/>
sent into 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Castell. Moreoever because
<newline/>
many Garrisons are disfournished, from whens 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
forsaid troupes have bin drawen, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e councell hath
<newline/>
written letters to all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Provinces, to induce them 
<newline/>
to make a further levie of 3000 foot, and 300 horse,
<newline/>
partly to supplie 
<image name="thorn"/>
e former defectes of their Garri-
<newline/>
sons, and partly to doe some further enterprise
<newline/>
uppon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemies contrey: wherunto, it is thought,
<newline/>
by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e having of Breda, they shall have many
<newline/>
opportunities. It is also resolved, that of 
<newline/>
those 
<image name="thorn"/>
at are appointed to remaine in Breda, there
<newline/>
shall be two foote companies, and one cornet of horse
<newline/>
of her

<newline/>
had newes to day, Whiche yet we feared, long agoe,
<newline/>
that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Garrison of Swartsluis in Overissel is newly
<newline/>
mutined, for want of pay. The place is of suche
<newline/>
importance, as it must be assured by all possible meanes,
<newline/>
wherein
