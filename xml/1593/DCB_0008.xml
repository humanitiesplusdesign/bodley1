The Councel having often consulted

Howbeit, before

<super id="2575" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 them in writing [to her Majestie]

at first as concerning

e supernumerary [bands]
<newline/>
it was an old complaint of theirs, and h[ad been]
<newline/>
answeared often in very good sort: and

they should doe well, having borne

many yeres together, to passe it for heerea[fter with]

were in common equitie to consider w

 [themselves]
<newline/>
that it was not possible for her Ma

<newline/>
her greater securitie, she had reserved to [her self]

so accorded by themeselves, in their Act of [Am-]

at if t[hey]

would seeme, to urge so strictly

e just num[ber]
<newline/>
expressed in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Treatie, they were to expect

at

<folioref id="0165">

 her Ma

 being weakned 
<image name="thorn"/>
at way in assurance
<newline/>
would demaunde some other towne, wherein as I
<newline/>
conceaved, they would be very backward. More-
<newline/>
over her Hig
<super id="0176" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
 did finde, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at those townes were
<newline/>
become a great deale more populous, then they were
<newline/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e time, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Treatie was made: so as none of
<newline/>
those 
<image name="thorn"/>
at she hath chosen to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e gouvernment of them,
<newline/>
would undertake to keepe them, w
<super id="0189" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
at restriction to
<newline/>
the number, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at is mentioned in

e Contract. And
<newline/>
though I knowe very well, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e intention of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
contrey was sincere and direct, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at there was
<newline/>
no cause, to calle in question 
<image name="thorn"/>
at affection, w
<super id="0203" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
<newline/>
they bare unto her Ma
<super id="0207" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 yet occasions might falle
<newline/>
of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e breache of this amitie, as was often times seene
<newline/>
between Princes and contreis in greatest c
<overline id="0213" replace="on">
o

junction.
<newline/>
For w
<super id="0232" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 it was expedient, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e foresaid places should
<newline/>
not onely be assured against 
<image name="thorn"/>
e power of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie,
<newline/>
w
<super id="0235" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I thought might be done w

t
</super>
 a very fewe souldiers
<newline/>
and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e aide of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Burghers, but if occasion so requi
<newline/>
red, against those attemptes 
<image name="thorn"/>
at might be made by
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e states themselves, or those 
<image name="thorn"/>
at are inhabitants.
<newline/>
For howsoever it be presumed, as it might very
<newline/>
well, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at no suche mater will come to passe, yet 
<image name="thorn"/>
ei
<newline/>
could not be ignorant, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at garrison souldiers and
<newline/>
burghers are many times at variance, and growe
<newline/>
often on 
<image name="thorn"/>
e soddaine to termes of hostilitie. W
<super id="0251" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 if
<newline/>
it should happen by any accident in Flushing, it is
<newline/>
knowen to all 
<image name="thorn"/>
at contrey, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at there are of 
<image name="thorn"/>
at towne
<newline/>
and belonging therunto 3000 mariners at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e lest
<newline/>
w
<super id="0262" replace="hich">

<newline/>
a case 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state would be able, to beare any [sway]
<newline/>
in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e appeacing of their furie, it was nee[deles for]
<newline/>
me to signifie unto them. For these a[and other]
<newline/>
like causes, I wished them to make no motio[n unto her]

Ma
<super id="0327" replace="jestie">

</super>
 of anie suche mater: for 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I was sure s[he would]
<newline/>
take displeasure at it, and they in their [suit]

should be nothing

e neerer. And [where they]
<newline/>
doe alleage 
<image name="thorn"/>
e excessive charges of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey, [in dis-]
<newline/>
boursing of service mony, it was but a shewe [of a]
<newline/>
mater [of] weight, and was nothing in effect [. For if]
<newline/>
the supernumeraries were not kept in Flus[hing they]
<newline/>
must be placed somewhere els, and lodged as [in Flushing]
<newline/>
w
<super id="0289" replace="hich">
ch

 in regard of their expense would come

to one account. But to meete w
