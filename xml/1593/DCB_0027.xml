 they have no meanes to repasse that exployt, The place to

be assieged is so deere unto thennemy as in every mans opinion he will

straine to relieve it w

th

 his uttermost power, And how this contrey wilbe

hable to maintayne such a siege boath by land and by water, neyther

sydered, whatsoever can by sayd, both for the bennefytt of

swaded that yf the place be obtayned through hir Highnes assistance
