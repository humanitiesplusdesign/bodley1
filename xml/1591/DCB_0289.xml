 selves, soe as wee
<newline/>
would have left the defence of the States and thes Provinces: But
<newline/>
contrariewise to thos large and favorable offers, wee utterlie refused
<newline/>
to assent to anie Accord w

th
</super>
 all Conditions both of
<newline/>
Religion and of theire pollecies and liberties, as largelie as had been
<newline/>
by them heretofore required: The refusall whereof on the part of
<newline/>
the K. of Spaigne, was the onelie Cawse that wee refused the
<newline/>
peace offred by him, by the sequell whereof, it was and is seen
<newline/>
into what danger o

th
</super>
 a most
<newline/>
chargeable and dangerous warre, whearein wee are yet as the
<newline/>
world seeth still encombred: soe as yt maie appeare wee did not
<newline/>
treate to the prejudice of theare States, but refused peace for o

<newline/>
But to all naturall men of anie wisedome there can be noe greate
<newline/>
nor more weightie reason, in the sight of God and man than this
<newline/>
[later] when wee refused peace for their sakes, whearebye they are
<newline/>
bound to us even for them selves, and their posteritie, with the

Band of all humanitye, besides the Band of Reverence, w
