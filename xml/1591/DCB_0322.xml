e Enemies campe was
<newline/>
full of fires: w

ch

 was taken for a token of their

soddaine departure. Many upon it were sent

abroade, both horse and foote, pesants and others, to

learne w

after prisoners. But by

e
<newline/>
advenues of his campe, w
<super id="1002" replace="hich">
ch

 were very fewe, were
<newline/>
diligently garded, and all commers in so streightly
<newline/>
detened, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at we continued alwaies doubtfull
<newline/>
whether his fires were but strategemes, to bring
<newline/>
us onward, or that his meaning were otherwise,
<newline/>
directly to be gone. Nevertheles 
<image name="thorn"/>
e next day
<newline/>
after there were 
<image name="thorn"/>
at sent us worde from neutral
<newline/>
places, that for certaine his forces were in trans-

porting to 
<place id="3819" place_id="Niemegen">
Nieumeghen

 side: wherupon there
<newline/>
were 3000 footemn, and 700 horse sent thi-
<newline/>
therward, who approched so neere to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemies
<newline/>
campe, as they forced a

corps de garde
</foreign>
 w
<super id="1020" replace="ith">
t
</super>
in
<newline/>
their trenches, and might easely discerne that
<newline/>
thay had divers of their footmen in order of bat-
<newline/>
tel, upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e waters side. O
<super id="1030" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 troupes remained
<newline/>
there for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e space of two houres together, but per-
<newline/>
ceaving that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie was unwilling to 
<insertion id="1037">
come to
</insertion>
 blowes,
<newline/>
and finding no securitie in assaulting their trenches,
<newline/>
being also uncertaine, howe many of his campe
<newline/>
were passed 
<image name="thorn"/>
e river, 
<image name="thorn"/>
ei returned homewarde
<newline/>
<folioref id="1046">
fol.229r
</folioref>
 that night. Howbeit this morning we had a letter
<newline/>
sent hither from out of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e sconce, whereby we were
<newline/>
assured, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e greatest pa
rt of his troupes were
<newline/>
already gone over. Againe therupon we sent
<newline/>
thither 
<image name="thorn"/>
e like forces, as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e day before: but founde
<newline/>
no enemie when 
<image name="thorn"/>
ei came. For all their campe
<newline/>
was lodged in sight, on 
<image name="thorn"/>
e other side, of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Wael.
<newline/>
What they purpose to doe next, we can not yet
<newline/>
conjecture. It is said by o
<super id="1064" replace="ur">

</super>
 prisoners, and we
<newline/>
have it otherwise by other intelligence, that they
<newline/>
goe undoubtedly for 
<place id="3822" place_id="France">
Fraunce.
</place>
 But yet we 
<newline/>
are persuaded, that untill 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
what way will be taken by 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
he will keepe in these quarters. Yesterday
