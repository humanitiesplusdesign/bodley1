<image name="thorn"/>

e people assuredly doe mur-

mur more and more, and they are earnestly
<newline/>
bent to stoppe

e passage of

, if 
<image name="thorn"/>
e souldiers passe
<newline/>
in troupes, but they have taken suche order, as they
<newline/>
can not come single. And although S
<super id="0512" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 John Norreis
<newline/>
hath charged

cease his paiment, after

e 20 day of this moneth,
<newline/>
supposing by that meanes, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e townes must be
<newline/>
forced to permitte them to depart, yet undoub-
<newline/>
tedly 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey is so sharply sette against it, as
<newline/>
they will minister for a time, sufficient victualles
<newline/>
to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e souldiers, till they see there is no remedie,
<newline/>
but that her Hig
<super id="0536" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 will persist in her purpose in-
<newline/>
tended. In this troublesome case, the
<newline/>
C
a
ptaines are so doutfull, what course they should
<newline/>
folowe, as they write their letters every day to 
<newline/>
knowe my advise. And for mine owne part, con-
<newline/>
sidering 
<image name="thorn"/>
e importance of

e mater, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e discontent-

of cassing 
<image name="thorn"/>
e companies, w
<super id="0550" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 most men hold opi-

nion, will scatter away by multitudes, considering
<newline/>
also that S
<super id="0555" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 John Norreis hath bin in England this
<newline/>
sevenight, that her Hig

<newline/>
is effectually informed of

e state of these affaires,

<folioref id="0565">
fol.184v

 and that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e winde hath bin good to bring us letters
<newline/>
from home, I have advised every captaine, to stay
<newline/>
the cassing of their bandes, till her Ma
<super id="0571" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 further
<newline/>
pleasure shall be notified unto them. The time,
<newline/>
I trust, will be but short, and a litle attendance
<newline/>
will be nothing prejudiciall to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e effecting of her
<newline/>
purpose. Rather I am persuaded, whensoever her
<newline/>
Hig
<super id="0580" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 shall resolve to drawe her subjectes from hens,
<newline/>
in suche sort as is begonne, this protracting of

a

lifie these mens

would be otherwise. For I doe assure yo

will shewe themselves more conformable.
