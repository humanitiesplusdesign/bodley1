 I wilbee as earnest in their sutes, as

<newline/>
But yet in my opinon, as I have flatly told him, unles I had
<newline/>
some cause to alleaye against Crooke, they will so much dislike
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e nature of his sute, as

more opposit, against him in espetiall. For as in my former I
