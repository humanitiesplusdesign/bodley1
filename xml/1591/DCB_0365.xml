<newline/>
And as for his promise to doe any thing nowe,
<newline/>
<folioref id="2360">
fol.274r

 it had no apparance of any successe. I told

him in conclusion,

at he had given his worde

unto me, w
<super id="2366" replace="hich">

that they had made over their mony to certaine

that M

 Winter, by reason of his promise, had

neglected all other meanes to procure hi

<super id="2386" replace="hich">
ch

 respect I should be sorie,
<newline/>
that her Ma

 should finde so just a cause to be

offended w

 he would signifie
