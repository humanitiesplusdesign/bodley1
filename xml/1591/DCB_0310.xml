 May it please yo

r
</super>
 good L. It is nowe de-
<newline/>
termined, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e towne of Groeninghen
<newline/>
shall be presently attempted: for whiche 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
troupes are risen, and marching already.
<newline/>
Their artillerie is embarcked and sent
<newline/>
away before. But whether they will use 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
benefit of her Hig
<super id="2001" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 letters, w
<super id="2004" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 were written
<newline/>
so long sins, and I have still in my custody,
<newline/>
I can not readily conjecture. But being often
<newline/>
required  by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Councels letters to repaire
<newline/>
unto them, I thinke they have a meaning,
<newline/>
when no other meanes will serve their turne,
<newline/>
to use 
<image name="thorn"/>
e countenance of her Ma
<super id="2015" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
. If it
<newline/>
come to that passe, I will advise upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
best for her Hignes contentac
<overline id="2021" replace="io">
o

n. For I have
<newline/>
seene by good tokens, that Count William is 
<newline/>
afraid to be sette byside 
<image name="thorn"/>
e government, if
<newline/>
the towne be reduced by her Ma
<super id="2029" replace="jesties">

<newline/>
for w
<super id="2033" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I thinke he will endevor to prevaile
<newline/>
an other way. The party whiche
<newline/>
I imploied about 
<image name="thorn"/>
e recoverie of those papers
<newline/>
and bookes, that came out of spaine, hath
<newline/>
spedde of his purpose, and hath all already 
<newline/>
in his custody. Because his dwelling is in
<newline/>
Amsterdam, and my way into Frise, (where
<newline/>
I thinke within these two daies to meete 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Councell) is by Amsterdam, I will take the
<newline/>
writinges to my self, and convey them from
<newline/>
thens by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e speediest meanes that I can finde.
<newline/>
