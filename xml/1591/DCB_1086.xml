<super id="0030" replace="hich">

 I found at

e Hage, at my returne
<newline/>
from Nieumeghen, I have had some conference w

<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e amendement of their Placart, for their trafficke w
<super id="0040" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Ennemie.
<newline/>
Howbeit they consulted uppon it before I returned, having had from M
<super id="0044" replace="aster">
r
</super>
<newline/>
Caron 
<image name="thorn"/>
e considerations of the pointes w
<super id="0050" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 were delivered from 
<image name="thorn"/>
e LL.
<newline/>
And as in every other matter, that is of any weight, it is the course of their
<newline/>
government, not to take a resolution w
<super id="0056" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out 
<image name="thorn"/>
e privitie of their Principals,
<newline/>
so they say in this matter, they will impart it to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Provinces, and answear
<newline/>
it assoone as conveniently they may. And because their present answear
<newline/>
doth import nothing els, w
<super id="0066" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is not worthy of a letter, to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e LL. of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Counsel,
<newline/>
I shall humblie beseeche you to report it for me. Moreover I am
<newline/>
required by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e LL. to demaund a fuller answear, to all suche matters as
<newline/>
were proposed at M
<super id="0073" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Wilkes being heere: w
<super id="0076" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I have not yet perfourmed,
<newline/>
desiring by your L. to understand once againe their pleasures therin. For
<newline/>
I knowe they will calle uppon me, to signifie w
<super id="0081" replace="hat">
t
</super>
 pointes are most misliked
<newline/>
by her Ma
<super id="0085" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 and will require a full replie to every article of their
<newline/>
answear. For in effect, it was all rejected w
<super id="0089" replace="hat">
at
</super>
seover was demaunded.
<newline/>
And if that be the meaninge of their LL. that I shall make 
<image name="thorn"/>
at Replie,
<newline/>
I will first contrive it heere, and after send it home to be changed in suche
<newline/>
sorte, as their LL. shall see cause. Nevertheles if your L. will be plea
<newline/>
sed to heare my opinion, I doe assure my selfe, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I shall never prevaile
<newline/>
by replieinge unto them, unles her Hig
<super id="0369" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 w
<super id="0104" replace="ith">
t
</super>
drawing some part of her
<newline/>
assistaunce from hens. Before w
<super id="0111" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 time, for her Ma
<super id="0108" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 to attempt
<newline/>
any one thinge often, and to obtene nothinge at any time, but still to be
<newline/>
refused, and to beare it w
<super id="0116" replace="">
th
</super>
 patience, it is to encourage them greatly, to
<newline/>
persist in their courses. Moreover to my simple seeminge, it is no fitte
<newline/>
opportunitie, to enter farre w
<super id="0373" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 this people in any bitter contestation, by
<newline/>
reason of these motions, whiche are towardes about a peace. So as for
<newline/>
mine owne part, consideringe that their warres are happely conducted, I
<newline/>
shoulde earnestly incline, to recommend unto her Ma
<super id="0124" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 some littell
<newline/>
longer tolleration. God hath blessed of late their martial endeavours,
<newline/>
in a wonderfull manner, that if the townes of Steenwicke, Boisleduke, and
<newline/>
Gertrudenbergh were recovered, wherof the hope is very great in the
<newline/>
next Sommers service, undoubtedly these Provinces would rest in great
<newline/>
assurance. And if it sould so happen, or also otherwise, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Frenche
<newline/>
Kinges affaires going prosperously forward, her Ma
<super id="0135" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 in my conceat, may
<newline/>
spare all the charges of her forces heere in feilde: and ether put them over
<newline/>
to be paied by the States, in part or in whole, or if the States be
<newline/>
unwilling, to be presently cassed. For when the Country is once assured,
<newline/>
there is no suche daunger of the Enemy, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at w
<super id="0143" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 those forces, w
<super id="0146" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they
<newline/>
have nowe in esse, they wilbe able well enough to defend their Country:
<newline/>
or if they be not, their generall meanes will suffice to increase their nom-
<newline/>
bers, to as many as her Ma
<super id="0153" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 will defalke. This day

<newline/>
there is made by the Counsell of State an earnest proposition to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e general
<newline/>
States, w
<super id="0170" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is to be imparted to every Province and towne, for an extra
<newline/>
ordinary Contribution, to the summe of nintie thowsande poundes sterling
<newline/>
for the levieng of newe forces 
<image name="thorn"/>
e next spring; and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at the mony may be
<newline/>
receaved, by the General Receavor of the Countrey, to be dispensed by
<newline/>
the Councel of State. They doe not make any doubt, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Provinces will yeelde unto it. I have bin written to of late by Joes
<newline/>
Van Cleve (w

e last

t
</super>
 those of Groeninghen) who informeth me as muche as I write
<newline/>
unto your L. 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 4 of this moneth, that the people w
<super id="0190" replace="ith">
th
</super>
in the towne are
<newline/>
greatly distracted, not knowing w
<super id="0194" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 way to bend their course. For some
<newline/>
are very willing to present themselves unto her Ma
<super id="0198" replace="jestie">

</super>
 and some are
<newline/>
more desirous to accord w
<super id="0202" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 the States, as also the Spaniard hath
<newline/>
a great many favourers. In this their perplexitie I have followed
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e advise of Joes Van Cleve, who hath wished me to addresse an other
<newline/>
letter to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Magistrats and Commons of the towne; w
<super id="0210" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I have don
<newline/>
to suche purpose, as yo
<super id="0217" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. may see by the copie in Englishe, w
<super id="0214" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I sent
<newline/>
to them in Dutche; w
<super id="0224" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I trust is so indited, as if it turne her Ma
<super id="0221" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
to no benefit, it cannot prejudice her honor or service in any thing. I
<newline/>
have not imparted it heere to any of the States, findinge heeretofore
<newline/>
by their jalouse proceedinges, that neither they are desirous, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
towne shoulde come under her Ma
<super id="0232" replace="jesties">

</super>
 obeissance, nor that themselves
<newline/>
should recover it by her Ma
<super id="0378" replace="jesties">

 autoritie. Concerninge the
<newline/>
affaires at touche the Gouvernor of Ostend, I followed

 he was charg

<missing id="0397" type="binding">
th
</missing>
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at your L. doth require e particular verifications of the pointes at I
<newline/>
proposed. But as I writte unto your L. when I sent you the copie,
<newline/>
of that I writte unto the Gouvernor, I did but certefie suche matters
<newline/>
as I conceaved of my selfe to be most materiall, thinkinge if his

I could not conveniently w

require of this Councel, I shall not be so subject to some privat displeasures

<newline/>
pardon in this case my confident writing: for I must say, as I doe finde

at unles there be some error in a peece of an arti
