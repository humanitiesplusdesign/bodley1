he is in hope to intertene us that way, till the

Whe

her it be to come directly thither, or to invade

we can not yet understand. But

in the extraordinary furtherance of this present

 recken that they come at

I knowe not very well, howe my letters from

Before I had shutte up my letter,

as it seemeth, Count Maurice is bent, or

who thinke
