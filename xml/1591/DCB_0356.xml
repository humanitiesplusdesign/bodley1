not onely no affection to hearcken unto it, but

they are passionatly bent to oppose against it.
<newline/>
onely one thing, I doe see, doth trouble them

muche, howe to finde a fitte excuse, to stoppe
<newline/>

e course of those Ambassado
<super id="3520" replace="">

 for comming
<newline/>
further onward. For first, they thinke,
<newline/>
they will pretend some other causes of their
<newline/>
comming, then to motion a Pacification:
<newline/>
and then againe they are persuaded, that all

those of

at if they be rejected,

it may putte them heere in danger of

out

any prejudice to themselves or to

<overline id="3626" replace="ener">
nr

al states, they were lothe
<newline/>
to hearcken to it: alleaging nothing to

e purpose,
<newline/>
but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they would reserve that course of pro-
<newline/>
ceeding for a better opportunitie. But as farre
<newline/>
as I can conjecture, they are inwardly afraid
<newline/>
that if

 threupon should seeke
<newline/>
unto her Ma

 they might finde their audience

<newline/>
they perhaps heere would willingly have it.
<newline/>
For mine owne part, though I see they are Ene-
