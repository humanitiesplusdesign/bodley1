, the next day in the morning I presented
<newline/>
her letters to suche of Holland as are deputed in the absence 
<newline/>
of the States, to receave all addresses. For the assembly
<newline/>
it self
 of the General States is dissolved for a time, w
<super id="1452" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they
<newline/>
terme a Recesse, till the 10 of December, and every Deputy
<newline/>
departed to his special Province, leaving the charge of receaving
<newline/>
and opening of suche letters as are directed to the States
<newline/>
to some certaine of 
<place id="1566" place_id="Holland">
Holland,
</place>

recesse of the

 being earnestly urged to shewe her M

<newline/>
letters to the

, and to joine in consultation

about some order to be taken for contenting of her Hig
<super id="1467" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
<newline/>
they assembled yesternight in the college of the Councel,
<newline/>
where the letter being read, and so muche added by me, as I 
<newline/>
thought expedient to be spoken, it was the opinion of them
<newline/>
all, that w
<super id="1474" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out the assent of their superio
<super id="1477" replace="">
rs
</super>
, to witte of the
<newline/>
Provinces, it was not in their power to accord her M
<super id="5099" replace="ajesties">
ties
</super>
<newline/>
demaund. Howbeit after long debating too and fro, it was
<newline/>
resolved in the ende, but w
<super id="1483" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 very muche a doe, that albeit
<newline/>
they might not by any meanes licence those troupes w
<super id="1487" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 her
<newline/>
Hig
<super id="1491" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 required to be drawen from hens, for that it onely
<newline/>
belonged to the generallitie of the contrey, yet they would
<newline/>
be contented to let them passe by way of co
<overline id="1496" replace="nn">
n
</overline>
ivation, and
<newline/>
sufferance, as if it were onely done by us that are heere.
<newline/>
<folioref id="1501">
fol.217v
</folioref>
 for her M
<super id="1504" replace="ajestie">
tie
</super>
. But this condition was annexed, that I should
<newline/>
solemnely undertake, that the troupes should be sent backe
<newline/>
againe w
<super id="1509" replace="ith">
t
</super>
in the space of 3 monethes. This condition, I
<newline/>
signified, was beyonde any charge that I had receaved.
<newline/>
Onely this I was willed to promise unto them, and in her
<newline/>
M
<super id="1515" replace="ajesties">
ties
</super>
 behalf I would assure, that assoone as the service of
<newline/>
<place id="1576" place_id="Rouen">

</place>
 and 
<place id="1580" place_id="Newhaven">
Newehaven
</place>
 is ended, w
<super id="1519" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 in all probablitie will
<newline/>
be done in lesse time, then they had prescribed, ether the
<newline/>
self same companies, or others in their places, shall be
<newline/>
presently returned. As also I supposed, that those other
<newline/>
Englishe forces, w
<super id="1526" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 were already come to Rouen, would all
<newline/>
be revoked about a time, wereby they should receave there
<newline/>
companies againe w
<super id="1531" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 a rounde renforcement, and happely
<newline/>
also some supplie for all the rest that are heere in her M
<super id="1535" replace="ajesties">
ties
</super>
<newline/>
pay. Wherupon they condescended to her M
<super id="1539" replace="ajesties">
ties
</super>
 request.
<newline/>
And this I thought meete w
<super id="1543" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 all possible speede to advertise
<newline/>
her Hig
<super id="1553" replace="hnes">

 purposing presently to joine w
<super id="1550" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 S
<super id="1547" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 Francis Vere
<newline/>
for giving suche direction to the 
<person id="1584" person_id="Sparhawk, J">
Commissary Sparhawke
</person>
<newline/>
as there may not any time be lost, for dispatche of the
<newline/>
souldiers. In this whole negotiation although her M
<super id="1559" replace="ajestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
had willed me, in case they should refuse to assent to her
<newline/>
demaund, that all endevo
<super id="1567" replace="">
r
</super>
 should be used to effect it w
<super id="1564" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out
<newline/>
them, yet because I was not forced to signifie so muche,
<newline/>
finding them ready to doe all that they could, I abstened
<newline/>
from delivering that point of my charge. Moreover
<newline/>
I made no motion unto them for sending any bandes of
<newline/>
their owne forces, for that of them selfes I knowe they
<newline/>
will not, and if they would, they can not, w
<super id="1577" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out the licence
<newline/>
of their Principals. Howbeyt for shipping for the river
<newline/>
of Sene, the 
<person id="1588" person_id="Biron">
Mareschall of Biron
</person>
 hath written very often
<newline/>
<folioref id="1583">
fol.218r
</folioref>
 and earnestly unto them, and they have already alotted
<newline/>
6 good shippes for that purpose, w
<super id="1587" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I thinke are prepared
<newline/>
to sett forward to day. If her M
<super id="1591" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 be desirouse to
<newline/>
have those companies complete that goe from hens, it
<newline/>
will be requisit that some 100 or more, be sent out of

 For heere I see no likelihoode, howe it

can be perfourmed.
