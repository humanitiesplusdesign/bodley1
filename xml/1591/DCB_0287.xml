was forced to deliver them vittailles, from out of

e Magasin of

, as
<newline/>
likewise to my self, to specifie precisely, that in

e

<newline/>
and because I have considered as carefully of it,
<newline/>
as is possible for me, and doe finde it every mans

e reasons I alleaged in my former Letters
<newline/>
to yo

r

 L. that this course of cassing is full of

<newline/>
in their Garrisons, till her Ma
<super id="0827" replace="jesties">

</super>
 pleasure shall be
<newline/>
notified further. For this will folowe of necessitie,
<newline/>
that after they are cassed, because 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states have
<newline/>
provided, that they shall not be transported, with
<newline/>
any shipping of these contreis, they must be forced to
<newline/>
attend for meanes out of

 And in that

case

but 4 or 5 at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e most, to dissolve 
<image name="thorn"/>
e companies
<newline/>
so long before, would serve to litle purpose for their
<newline/>
speedier transportation. Moreover
<newline/>
considering howe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e winde hath stoode for this fortnight,
<newline/>
and continueth at this present, it was muche to be
<newline/>
feared, when 
<image name="thorn"/>
e troupes had bin discharged, so ma-

ny men, for so long a time, and all at libertie, would

<image name="thorn"/>
e people of the
<newline/>
contrey shall both refuse to admitte them to their
<newline/>
townes, and minister no assistance for their
<newline/>
vittailles and passage. And though it may be
<newline/>
presumed, that to be ridde of suche ghestes, the
<newline/>
contrey will ordene, that

<newline/>
meanes to depart, yet undoubtedly they are so
<newline/>
bent, that thear is nothing to begotten at their

handes but by violence, and untill they see by
<newline/>
a second charge,

<newline/>
The consideration herof, and of divers

move me to endevor for mine owne part, and to
