not stretche to

it was a mater of great expense, and required

to solicite

e states in

at behalf, and Count Mau-
<newline/>
rices answear had put me cleane out of hope,
<newline/>
of speeding in my motion, yet because I per-
<newline/>
ceaved, that nothing could be done but by
<newline/>
meanes of

letter unto them, requesting both

 them heere, assoone as they

came, omitting nothing that I thought might

drawe them forward to doe somwhat. Their

e same in effect, as I

receaved of Count Maurice. That they had no
