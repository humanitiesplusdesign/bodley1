Guelders,
</place>
<newline/>
enjoining to bring away their troupes, or if the

contrey should refuse, to provide them of meanes,
<newline/>
to marche quietly away, that then every captaine

should casse his owne company, and appoint a

 It can not be gainsaied

but that her Ma

<image name="thorn"/>
e use of her forces
<newline/>

<image name="thorn"/>
e good
<newline/>
<folioref id="1768">
fol.151v
</folioref>
 of these contreis, as to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e preservation of her owne,
<newline/>
yet undoubtedly heere, unles we doe observe that
<newline/>
course of proceeding, w
<super id="1775" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state of their affaires,
<newline/>
and the peoples humo
<super id="1781" replace="">
rs
</super>
 doe require, it may growe very
<newline/>
dangerous to execut her purpose. In whiche respect
<newline/>
S
<super id="1786" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 John Norreis and I doe somwhat differ in judgement.
<newline/>
For he doth seeme to understand, that her Hig
<super id="1793" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
<newline/>
commaundement, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e having of her subjectes from
<newline/>
hens is peremptorie: and that w
<super id="1798" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out regard to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
states opposition, or to other perils in apparance, it
<newline/>
ought to be effected. But I doe gather an other mea-
<newline/>
ning by her Ma
<super id="1805" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 instructions, That if nether 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states
<newline/>
will assent to her Ma
<super id="1809" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 demaunde, nor convenient meanes
<newline/>
can be found, to drawe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e companies from hens,
<newline/>
that then S
<super id="1818" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 John Norreis should returne w
<super id="1815" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out atten-
<newline/>
ding further order. First for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states, I did never
<newline/>
see them so perplexed, as they are at this present:
<newline/>
nor I never knewe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e common people, to take any
<newline/>
thing more to hart: not so muche in respect, that
<newline/>
her Hig
<super id="1829" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 doth require, to have 
<image name="thorn"/>
e use of her subjectes,
<newline/>
as because they are in doubt, that they shall not
<newline/>
be returned, and because they ar thus called very
<newline/>
soddainly away, w
<super id="1837" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out any warning to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey,
<newline/>
in a greater nomber then they may spare, and by
<newline/>
way of cassing 
<image name="thorn"/>
e companies, w
<super id="1843" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they are greatly
<newline/>
afraid, will turne their estate to some notorious in-
<newline/>
convenience. Many good reasons have bin used, to
<newline/>
make them alter their conceats, and to persuade
<newline/>
them effectually to a better liking of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater.
<newline/>
But first they signifie flatly, that they can not, if
<newline/>
they would, w
<super id="1852" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out the privitie of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Provinces, dis-
<newline/>
misse any forces. And then againe, sins this letter
<newline/>
was begonne to be written to yo
<super id="1859" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. the states have
<newline/>
assembled, as they terme it, collegialiter, and com-
<newline/>
ming in as we sate in 
<image name="thorn"/>

<person id="0382" person_id="Council of State">
Councel of state

<newline/>
w
<super id="0379" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 great earnestnes, that for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e good of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey, and
<newline/>
for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e acquital of their owne duties, they had given

fol.152r

 in charge to their officers in all quarters, where 
<image name="thorn"/>
e En-
<newline/>
glishe men were placed, that they should not be assisted
<newline/>
w
<super id="1876" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 any vittailes, shippes, or needefull provision to passe
<newline/>
out of their Garrisons: and that they had made
<newline/>
a Protest against S
<super id="1881" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 John Norreis proceedinges, w
<super id="1884" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
<newline/>
they would presently send unto him, by a messenger
<newline/>
of purpose. And w
<super id="1889" replace="ith">
t
</super>
all they delivered there to me
<newline/>
an autentical Insinuation of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e said Protest, wherof
<newline/>
I will inclose the transcript in this letter. They 
<newline/>
have also sent

 Edward Norreis

. I for my part made that
<newline/>
answear there unto them, whiche I thought to be
<newline/>
fittest for

e appealing of their passions. I signified
<newline/>
that I was in good hope, they would better consider
<newline/>
of her Ma
<super id="1912" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 request, sins it stretched no further then
<newline/>
for 3 or 4 monethes, and would be greatly beneficial
<newline/>
to

e general cause. And in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e meane season, they
<newline/>
were to conceave, that her Ma

</super>
 had no meaning, to
<newline/>
have any thing in this action tumultuously attempted,
<newline/>
or to endanger their state in any respect. And thus

yo
