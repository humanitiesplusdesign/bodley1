they will not willingly lette me see them. And

as I am informed, they have examined him

written hither to

 w

t
</super>
 all their other informations, thereby to
<newline/>
justifie whatsoever they have written heeretofore.
<newline/>
But what course in conclusion will be taken
<newline/>
by them, I can not yet conjecture. For in
<newline/>
their publicke assembly it was never yet pro-
<newline/>
posed to be finally resolved, and I finde them
<newline/>
diversly affected in their privat communica-
<newline/>
tions: some of them urging to send for him hither,
<newline/>
and to proceede against his dealinges by order
<newline/>
of justice: others requiring 
<image name="thorn"/>
at some should be
<newline/>
deputed to goe to 
<place id="0240" place_id="Ostend">
Ostend,
</place>
 and there examine
<newline/>
and determine, as shall be thought expedient.
<newline/>
There are also some 
<image name="thorn"/>
at thinke it best, that all
<newline/>
their informations should be sent unto her Ma
<super id="0156" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
w
<super id="0162" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 earnest request to revoke him from thens:
<newline/>
whereto there are divers 
<image name="thorn"/>
at would willingly
<newline/>
condescend: but they would have 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Garrison
<newline/>
heereafter to be kept by a Governor and souldiers
<newline/>
of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey. But to all these opinions there
<newline/>
are among themselves, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at doe make oppositions.
<newline/>
For first they imagine 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he will not come, all-
<newline/>
though he were sent for: and to send unto him
<newline/>
thither, they thinke it not convenient, where ma-
<newline/>
ters are so evident, nor for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Councels reputa-
<newline/>
tion. To pray her Hig
<super id="0179" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 to revoke him, they
<newline/>
hold it prejudicial to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e liberties of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey,
<newline/>
considering it is a mater in their disposition.
<newline/>
That w
<super id="0229" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is lest gainsaid, is 
<image name="thorn"/>
e changing of the
<newline/>
Garrison: w

 yet they are in doubt will not

<newline/>
<folioref id="0197">
fol.354r
</folioref>
 to say truly, they are willinger then they have
<newline/>
bin, to conforme their proceedinges. These thinges
<newline/>
are but privatly thus debated, and nothing yet
<newline/>
sette downe by way of resolution. Howbeit I
<newline/>
attend every houre their meeting upon it, whiche
<newline/>
I thinke will be general, aswel of
