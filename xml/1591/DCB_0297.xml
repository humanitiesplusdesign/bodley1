<newline/>
The states of Guelders therupon writte letters
<newline/>
of intreaty in December last, that albeit their
<newline/>
order of proceeding was not wholy in forme ac-
<newline/>
cording to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Treaty, yet because Count Maurice
<newline/>
was sufficiently q
<super id="1130" replace="ua">
a
</super>
lified, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e meetest person
<newline/>
for 
<image name="thorn"/>

e Councel
<newline/>
in that respect, to dispense w
<super id="1140" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e forsaid Article,
<newline/>
and ratifie 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Election already made. It was
<newline/>
a mater muche debated in sundrie consulta-
<newline/>
tions, and as I am persuaded, had bin quietly
<newline/>
caried against 
<image name="thorn"/>
e meaning of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Contract, but
<newline/>
that I opposed somw
<super id="1149" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 earnestly against it.
<newline/>
For I urged precisely 
<image name="thorn"/>
e observation of the
<newline/>
forme, alleaging mine othe that bound me unto
<newline/>
it, a particular charge by reason of my place,
<newline/>
and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e danger of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e consequence, if the Councel
<newline/>
should dispense w
<super id="1161" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 any point of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Treaty.
<newline/>
For as it was concluded by her Ma
<super id="1165" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 and the
<newline/>
states, so in case of dispensation, w
<super id="1172" replace="ith">

out her Hig

nes
</super>
<newline/>
assent their actions were frustrat. Wherupon
<newline/>
for that time there was nothing done in
