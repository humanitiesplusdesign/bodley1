out any motion unto me, to have it proposed,

I will give him w

at
</super>
 assistance I shall any way
<newline/>
be able. But otherwise I am still of that opinion
<newline/>
that I imparted unto yow 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 14 of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e last.
<newline/>
<newline/>
It is greatly to be doubted, lest the
<newline/>
newe contribution, whiche is almost accorded
<newline/>
for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e levie of 3000 foote, and 300 horse, will
<newline/>
com
e to nothing. For I see by many tokens they
<newline/>
doe imagine already, that if 
<image name="thorn"/>
e forces of these
<newline/>
contreis shall be much more increased, her Ma
<super id="2271" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
will take it for a fitte opportunitie to lessen her
<newline/>
charges, in hope that as then 
<image name="thorn"/>
e w
<super id="2277" replace="ith">
t

drawing of her
<newline/>
subjectes will be voide of danger to their state.

 The speeche is given out, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="0668" person_id="States of Holland">
states of Hol-
<newline/>
land
</person>
 have already past their graunt, for
<newline/>
threescore thousand poundes sterling, for their
<newline/>
portion. They doe greatly dislike 
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e solicitation of  
<image name="thorn"/>
e Frenche, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e imploiment
<newline/>
of these forces in Brittaine: and I stand in
<newline/>
doubt therupon, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
at in a maner they speake
<newline/>
it openly, that they will not contribut to the
<newline/>
Germaine levies. The states doe re-
<newline/>
solve, as I am told at this instant, to write
<newline/>
unto her Ma
<super id="2302" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 out of hand, and shortly after to
<newline/>
send some person of purpose, to dissuade her in
<newline/>
this mater. For I never see them for any thing

But

e greater part

thing to be douted, yet because

morous, and guided by no man, and is withall

very weary of these daily exactions, wherewith

be feared, they will commit some soddaine folly,

from whiche they will not be reclamed by

any after persuasion. In w
