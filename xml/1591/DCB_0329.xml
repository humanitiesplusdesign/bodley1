 he thought was over faint
<newline/>
and cold, for a mater of that weight. And so it
<newline/>
was undoubtedly, when he writte his letter to

e vicount.
<newline/>
For 
<image name="thorn"/>
e offer from 
<image name="thorn"/>

as

bted very muche, unles they could procure to be

t
</super>
 some forraine assistance, a

great part of these quarters might be easely spoiled,

and the general state in daunger. But three

daies after

upon

 caused them soddainly,

ch

<newline/>
Then it was that Count Maurice writte his letter

to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Vicount, not refusing to accomplishe what-

soever had bin offered, but somw

earnestnes in respect of intreaty, and leaving it

wholy to

e vicount himself. For al-
<newline/>
aies before both 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states had this
<newline/>
persuasion, that unles they should be driven to
<newline/>
some extremitie by the Enemie, a short aboade of
<newline/>
that army, could bring but litle benefit, and that
<newline/>
it could not be so short, but
