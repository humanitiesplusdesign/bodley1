th

 sum others, maie justlie suffice, to putt of the Treatie./

<newline/>
The first is, w

ch
</super>
 alreadie hath been remembred, and maie be justlie re-
<newline/>
newed, that the States cannot in reason nor in polecie contrarie to their

of their libertie, and w

th
</super>
 whome and the States of hir Cuntrie, theie
<newline/>
and their Forefathers have by spetiall Treaties and Bondes, been
<newline/>
bownd for mutuall defence: and therefore w

th
</super>
owt rejecting to treate
<newline/>

<newline/>
<newline/>
A second reason maie be justlie alleged that wheare they are offred in

that he shall alter his disposic
<overline id="0320" replace="io">
