 May it please your good L. The 13
<super id="2369" replace="">
th
</super>
 of this moneth
<newline/>
I advertised your L of my being at 
<place id="5750" place_id="Dorkum">

 the

</person>
, from whence wee tooke o
<super id="2377" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 Journey
<newline/>
toward
<image name="es"/>
 the armie. But before wee came thether, wee
<newline/>
had worde from 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count, that the Enemy at 
<place id="5756" place_id="Groningen">
Groninghen
</place>
<newline/>
had opened certaine sluces, wherby of six part
<image name="es"/>
 about
<newline/>
the towne, there were five overflowen, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e armie
<newline/>
on 
<image name="thorn"/>
e suddaine forced to dislodge. The possibilitie to
<newline/>
let in the water was neither knowen to 
<person id="5759" person_id="Nassau, William">
Count William
</person>
<newline/>
nor to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Deputies of 
<place id="5762" place_id="Friesland">
Friesland,
</place>
 on whome the armie
<newline/>
depended for good direction in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e siege. For they were
<newline/>
all perswaded, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater of those sluces could not
<newline/>
hinder o
<super id="2399" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 approaches, nor 
<image name="thorn"/>
e planting of the Artillerie.
<newline/>
But since it fell out otherwise, it was thought convenient
<newline/>
that our forces should p
<overline id="2406" replace="resent">
nt
</overline>
ly marche toward
<image name="es"/>
 
<place id="5765" place_id="Delfzijl">
Delfzile
</place>
<newline/>
w
<super id="2410" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is a strong fort upon the Ems distant from
<newline/>
Groeninghen northeast, three long dutch miles. The
<newline/>
taking of this fort, because it serveth as a haven to
<newline/>
Groeninghen, was generallie thought of singular importance.
<newline/>
There was order also taken, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e artillerie, w
<super id="2418" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
<newline/>
was not yet disbarked, but onely kept in a redines in the
<newline/>
ships before Groeninghen, should bee brought to Delfzile
<newline/>
by water. Upon this resolution the Councel of state
<newline/>
finding no securitie for them selves to goe to Delfzile
<newline/>
by land, when 
<image name="thorn"/>
e troupes were departed, went thether
<newline/>
by shippe. Presentlie upon o
<super id="2428" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 coming the approaches
<newline/>
were made &amp; as yesternight the Artillerie made ready
<newline/>
to bee planted, wheruppon the Ennemy w
<super id="2433" replace="ith">
th
</super>
in albeit for
<newline/>
the space of three daies hee had shott uppon us very hotly
<newline/>
upon the first summoning condescended to a parle, and 
<newline/>
<folioref id="2439">
fol.156v
</folioref>
 surrendred presently upon like composition, as those of
<newline/>
<place id="5768" place_id="Deventer">
Deventer
</place>
 and 
<place id="5771" place_id="Zutphen">
Zutphen.
</place>
 Their want w
<super id="2443" replace="ith">
th
</super>
in was both
<newline/>
of men and powder, and no kinde of hope to be
<newline/>
relieved by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Spaniard. Gorningen excepted, there
<newline/>
are onely now remaining in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e territory of Groeningen the
<newline/>
forte of 
<place id="5774" place_id="Opslack">
Opslacht
</place>
 and 
<place id="5777" place_id="Emmentil">
Emmentile,
</place>
 w
<super id="2453" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 are fort
<image name="es"/>
 of some
<newline/>
strength, lieng southwest from Groningen w
<super id="2457" replace="ith">
th
</super>
in 2 or 3
<newline/>
 leagues, but unable to w
<super id="2461" replace="ith">
th
</super>
stand any forceable batterie.
<newline/>
For w
<super id="2465" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 it is resolved, that they shalbee summoned out of
<newline/>
hand. And as for those of Groningen it is first
<newline/>
intended, for that now it is thought they will hearken to
<newline/>
reason, that they shalbee moved by faire offers, to unite
<newline/>
them selves to the other Provinces. W
<super id="2473" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 if they chance to
<newline/>
reject, as moste men think they will, reposing no confidence
<newline/>
in any promise of the 
<person id="5780" person_id="States General">
States,
</person>
 then they do determine, as
<newline/>
I am told underhand (for as yet of them selves they doe
<newline/>
not signifie so much unto mee) to use her 
<person id="5783" person_id="Elizabeth">
Ma
<super id="2479" replace="jesties">
ts
</super>
</person>
<newline/>
countenance by my meanes, to the effect of that
<newline/>
commission w
<super id="2485" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 was graunted unto mee about 12 moneth
<newline/>
agoe. For mine owne part, because it is a
<newline/>
matter that doth touche them
s
elves, and because I
<newline/>
knowe it is their humor not to use her Ma
<super id="2491" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
, but as
<newline/>
a refuge in extremitie, I do not deale by 
<image name="par"/>
swasion
<newline/>
either on waie or other. For if they cannot speed
<newline/>
of themselves, they will come verie willinglie to crave
<newline/>
her Ma
<super id="2499" replace="jesties">
ts
</super>
 assistance, and otherwise for mee to move
<newline/>
them therunto, considering how sleightlie they regarded it
<newline/>
before, I knowe not how it would stand w

th
</super>
 her

many other their proceeding

 beare w

th
</super>
 their diffidence, and jalousie, and other
<newline/>
natural imperfections, but exact more precisely an
<newline/>
honorable cariage in their dealing, then the advauncement
<newline/>
of an action, shall but hinder that in the end, w

<newline/>
mighte bee otherwise effected, and do her Ma

information both by l

<newline/>
Besides, his nombers to

to exceed 6000 foote and 150 horse, w

 are also in

dissention, and in very great miserie, for verie many

great want

. In effect, for my self I did never
<newline/>
yet 
<image name="par"/>
ceave, that either the ennemy in these countreys

was ever so perlexed, or so likelie in all places to bee

dishonored in his actions, as hee is at this p
