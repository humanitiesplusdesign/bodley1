yo

 to conceave, and to certifie of me that I was

<newline/>
the postscript of yo
<super id="2044" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 letter, it hath bin suggested
<newline/>
by some of his frindes, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I doe hinder his pre-

ferment, by commending of Crooke to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="3113" person_id="Council of State">
Councel

: w

 I protest unto yo
<super id="2053" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. is their owne
<newline/>
imagination, and proceedeth from suche persons,
<newline/>
as litle heede others credit, to obtene their owne
<newline/>
desires. For in my life, that I remember, I had
<newline/>
never seene Crooke, but only then, when 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Councel
<newline/>
admitted him Provost, and at no time sins:
<newline/>
nor I can not calle to minde, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at for any other
<newline/>
cause, ether his name, or any action of his hath
<newline/>
bin mentioned sins in Councel, whereby I might
<newline/>
have cause, to praise or dispraise him, muche
<newline/>
lesse to recommend him, when I see 
<image name="thorn"/>
at her Hig
<super id="2074" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
<newline/>
was otherwise affected. As for M
<super id="2079" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Cham-
<newline/>
berlain I did so offer my self at first, and so 
<newline/>
continewe at this present, to doe him any plea-
<newline/>
sure, as I knowe not howe he can require
<newline/>
any more at my handes. I have wished him
<newline/>
to devise w
<super id="2087" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 all his frendes and to sette me
<newline/>
downe some course, by w
<super id="2092" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they thinke I may
<newline/>
prevaile in persuading this councel, and they
<newline/>
shall all of them see, that I will be as earnest
<newline/>
in their sutes as they can any way desire.
<newline/>
But in truth of my self, as I have often debated
<newline/>
both w
<super id="2099" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 him and w
<super id="2102" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 his frindes, I can not finde
<newline/>
<folioref id="2106">
fol.264v
</folioref>
 any meanes, to bring it presently to passe. To
<newline/>
propose it to this Councel, I am alwaies ready,
<newline/>
whensoever he will have me, and to do 
<insertion id="2141">
it
</insertion>
 in his
<newline/>
presence, that he may witnes of my forwardnes.
<newline/>
But yet in my opinion, as I have flatly told him,
<newline/>
unles I had some cause to alleage against Crooke,
<newline/>
they will so muche dislike 
<image name="thorn"/>
e nature of his sute,
<newline/>
as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e very motioning of it, will make them
<newline/>
more opposit, against him in speciall. For as in
<newline/>
my former I advertised yo
<super id="2123" replace="ur">

 L. they doe alwaies
<newline/>
maintene,

<newline/>
Moreoever it is mervailed at by some, that a
