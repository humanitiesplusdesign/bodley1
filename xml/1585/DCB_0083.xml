</person>
, from whom I doe not dout, but yo
<super id="0101" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 H. shall receave
<newline/>
it. Sins the writing therof, I was at 
<place id="0367" place_id="Harburg">
Harbourgh
</place>
 with the 
<person id="1004" person_id="Brunswick, Julius">
Duke
</person>
<newline/>
whose intertenment towardes me, and affection to my service,
<newline/>
was in every condition to my full satisfaction. Both by speech
<newline/>
&amp; by writing, I receaved that from him, 
<underline id="0110">
whiche I would wil-
<newline/>
lingly certifie,
</underline>
 but that I see no safetie from hens, to committ 
<newline/>
any thinge to letters.
<newline/>
<newline/>
Departing from Harbourgh, I came to 
<place id="0371" place_id="Wolfenbuttel">

<newline/>
gone in progresse, to take possession of the contreis, that were
<newline/>
lately fallen to him, by the death of 
<person id="0379" person_id="Calenburg, Eric">
D. Erricke

: and of his
<newline/>
counsail so many as taried behind, had intelligence of nothing
<newline/>
in the Electo
<super id="0121" replace="">
r
</super>
s proceeding. Wheruppon I resolved to goe after
<newline/>
the D. but they dissuaded me from it: for that his daily re-
<newline/>
mooving, did make his being uncertaine: &amp; for certaine other
<newline/>
respectes. So as in the end this advise was thought best, that
<newline/>
I should have in writing w
<super id="0128" replace="ith">

<newline/>
to convey unto the D. by a messenger of purpose: &amp; to send
<newline/>
w
<super id="0144" replace="ith">
t
</super>
all their owne letters, for my better expedition. And having
<newline/>
thus written, as they desired, they gave me counsail to remain
<newline/>
heere at 
<place id="0387" place_id="Brunswick">
Brunswicke
</place>
 (whiche is 6 miles of) till I heard
<newline/>
from the D. For at Wolfenbeitel in the D. absence, no

Yesterday, the 16 of this moneth, there came unto me from Wol-

answear to theirs: in whiche he willed them to tell me, that in

<newline/>
wished me, to stay still at Brunswicke, till he came againe to
<newline/>
Wolfenbeitel, where he purposed to be, about
