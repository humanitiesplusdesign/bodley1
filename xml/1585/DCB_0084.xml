 H. &amp; not altogether
<newline/>
trusting to the safe deliverie of my last, whiche I sent yow
<newline/>
from hens, the 17 of this moneth: I thought to signifie againe,
<newline/>
that when I came from 
<place id="0625" place_id="Hamburg">
Hambourgh
</place>
 to 
<place id="0628" place_id="Wolfenbuttel">
Wolfenbeitel
</place>
, the 
<person id="0631" person_id="Brunswick, Julius">
Duke
</person>
 was
<newline/>
gone in progresse, to take possession of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e lande of 
<person id="0634" person_id="Calenburg, Eric">
D. Erricke
</person>
<newline/>
deceased. Notw
<super id="0475" replace="ith">
t
</super>
standing, having notice both from me, &amp; from
<newline/>
his Counsailors, that I was come for mine answear: he sent me 
<newline/>
worde backe againe, that the Electo
<super id="0480" replace="">
r
</super>
s answear was not suche,
<newline/>
as did fully content him, &amp; therfore was desirous, that I
<newline/>
should stay heere at 
<place id="1176" place_id="Brunswick">
Brunswicke
</place>
, untill his comminge to
<newline/>
Wolfenbeitel, about the end of this moneth. 
<underline id="0487">
For by
</underline>
 that time
<newline/>
he thought, to receave somwhat els, to his better satisfaction.
<newline/>
<newline/>
If he had sent me a copie of the first, I should have waited
<newline/>
for the next, w
<super id="0493" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 a farre better liking. But because when I came
<newline/>
I found him not at home, &amp; none of his counsail instructed
<newline/>
what to tell me, nor nothing signified unto me, howe the Electo
<super id="0498" replace="">
r
</super>
s
<newline/>
were affected, I see no great occasion, to like of this delai-
<newline/>
enge.
<newline/>
<newline/>
In my other before, I writte more at large, of every particular
<newline/>
but of nothing in suche sort, as 
<deletion id="0506">
was
</deletion>
 I desired, &amp; was nedefull,
<newline/>
if I reposed any trust, in any messenger from hens. I was
<newline/>
putte then in hope, that 
<person id="1179" person_id="Paul, A">
Andreas Pauli
</person>
 had brought an answear
<newline/>
from the Electo
<super id="0512" replace="">

<newline/>
his letter to 
<person id="1182" person_id="Sidney, P">
S
<super id="0516" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 Philip
</person>
, whiche I thinke doth insinuat, some 
<newline/>
part of his opinion.
<newline/>
<newline/>
It is nowe reported in this towne, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e D. is looked for to 
<newline/>
morowe at Wolfenbeitell: whiche I trust will occasion my
<newline/>
shorter dispatche. And againe this present daye, the
<newline/>
Circle of Lowe Saxonie, beginneth at 
<place id="1185" place_id="Halberstadt">
Halberstat

he will take order, that her

t
</super>
 some of those de-
<newline/>
puties, that are in that assemblie, of principall autoritie.
<newline/>
And if any thing, at any time, will ever be obtened, this newe
<newline/>
conjunction nowe in 
<place id="1194" place_id="France">
Fraunce

, is a great provocation.

<newline/>
my former from Hambourgh. And though these affaires so

expedient, be not handled among them, yet I learne of som-
<newline/>
what els, that both is very pertinent, and doth touche them
<newline/>
very neere, and is a speciall occasion of their meeting 
<newline/>
at this time.
<newline/>
<newline/>
If I see any slacknes, when I come to the Duke, I will
