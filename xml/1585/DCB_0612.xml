&amp; speede it in suche sort, as the matter required. The K. therw

t
</super>
all 
<newline/>
tooke me by the hande, &amp; helde me still in talke, untill his diner

many questions, &amp; carouses to her Ma

 at whiche he gave her
<newline/>
that diner 33 shotte of great artillerie, I tooke occasion to

all, I did renewe that petition of her longinge to

see him, requestinge suche an answear, as when I came into my

see by his countenaunce &amp; cheere, &amp; every waye besides, that he
<newline/>
tooke a great pleasure to be urged so againe, &amp; made me answear,
<newline/>
that as God had appointed, so it should be. But if twentie yeres

<newline/>
he would be very lothe to be prevented by death, before he had seen

her: whome he solemnly protested, that if it were possible, he loved
<newline/>
better then his wife. With this &amp; other like talke, he dranke so

morely unto me, &amp; that so muche the more, for that in pledging
<newline/>
againe I made it no drinke, to answear to his humo

<newline/>
The next morninge the Chauncello

 charge: for that the K. could speake no Latin.
<newline/>
Wheruppon I imparted all unto him, the more freely, for that I found

<newline/>
Before diner a litle, I had some talke w
