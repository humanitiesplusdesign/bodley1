I caused

used some speeches unto them, to hasten their assistance,

they in their aunswear declared unto me,

at as yet they
<newline/>
had no notice of any demaundes, and therfore they required
<newline/>
me, to exhibit them in writing, or to signifie by worde,

what matter they contained. And when they found by

my replie,
