ere this would have yelded to 
<person id="10185" person_id="Maurice">
Co: Maurice
</person>
, which hath caused me to staye
<newline/>
from writing of

e Parley, which began the second of this moneth, and
<newline/>
continued till the sixte. They have been content to receave Co: Maurice

as the Count was informed by the meanes of a priso

 to attend but 9 dayes longer promising by

of Co. Maurice to have 6 dayes respite to deliberate, which was neith

<newline/>
accorded nor rejected, soe as our armie doth proceede in the advancing

within 1 lenght of a pike of

therwithall to gette possession of a Ravelin, soe as it is thought, that

sith Verdugo is not able to send them any succor, for that the passages

are stopped the Towne will be ours by faire meanes or by force, within

the space of xx dayes, which is a matter more importing the good
<newline/>
estate of these Contreis, then as many Townes and places as they have
<newline/>
taken these three yeares. For it will not be onelie an assurance for
