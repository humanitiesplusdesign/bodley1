Portesmouth
</place>
<newline/>
before the fifth of this present moneth. And now to explaine
<newline/>
the demaund
<image name="es"/>
 as they were made, It is true there were demaunded
<newline/>
xij shippes at the least, &amp; victuall
<image name="es"/>
 for 2000 men, that might
<newline/>
serve by land for two monethes, &amp; as I think but 20000

 to more Certaintie hir Ma

</super>
 can be Contented
<newline/>
w
<super id="1471" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 tenne shippes, if otherwise, the States should not yeld to xij
<newline/>
and for the victuall
<image name="es"/>
 considering that w
<super id="1474" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is alledged by yow of
<newline/>
the dearth of victuall
<image name="es"/>
 there, &amp; the cheapnes here, that demaund
<newline/>
may be forborne, although at this p
<overline id="11690" replace="resent">
nt
</overline>
 by the unseasonablenes of
<newline/>
the yeare, I think the dearth of victuall
<image name="es"/>
 is more here then
<newline/>
there, Considering the provision of Corne, that readelie is to be
<newline/>
had out of the East Countryes into those./ As for the small
<newline/>
quantitie of powder demaunded, I thinke the same was mistaken
<newline/>
in writing, for indeed 20000 
<abbreviation id="1489" replace="weight">
wz
<super id="1486" replace="">
t
</super>
</abbreviation>
 of powder is litle more,
<newline/>
then 8 last
