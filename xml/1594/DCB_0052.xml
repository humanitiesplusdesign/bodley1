e uttermost
<newline/>
degree to second her designe and whensoever they maye knowe her

finall resolution, they will presently arme their Navie. For they
<newline/>
thincke it very necessarie, that they should first be made acqua-

e ende they
<newline/>
maye proceede with a sownd deliberation, and provide themselves
<newline/>
there after of everie thinge requisit. That otherwise (if they

Heere is no resolution taken for anie further imploiment of
