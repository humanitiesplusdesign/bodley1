gether,

at by her gratious mediation, as I had formerly

requested, and she had alsoe promised, I should be restored

that she knew no other of you, but

with her purpose, and

at I (as it seemed, had receaved

no such l

at perhaps it had miscaried. But
<newline/>
yet she pre
ssed me soe neere, in

e course of her spee-
<newline/>
hes, as if it could not be otherwise, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it came
<newline/>
unto my handes, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I was driven to protest upon
