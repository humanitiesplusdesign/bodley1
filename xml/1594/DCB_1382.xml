expresse xij shippes, where their wryting is for

tenne, soe as by my wrytinge, you had good warrant
<newline/>
to presse them for xij, being more advantage to the

service; and yf you account that a fawlt in my wryting
<newline/>
I am content to aunswere thereto afore any that shall
<newline/>
blame me therfore: and where also you say that my diretion

ys

 the shipping should come to

Portesmouth,

 and Carons
<newline/>
wryting to 
<place id="6992" place_id="Dover">
Dovar

 or the Downes, I am glad also that
<newline/>
my direction hath more advantage for the service, and
<newline/>
yet to reconcile both 
<foreign id="1861" Translation="" Language="Latin">
distinguenda sunt tempora
</foreign>
, for when
<newline/>
Caron had his order o
<super id="1865" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 shipping was then to goe owt
<newline/>
of the Thanni so as then the meeting of both the fleete
<newline/>
was intended to be at Dovar or the Downes: But
<newline/>
afterwarde by the co
<overline id="6995" replace="mm">
m
</overline>
ing owt of time, and the Quenes
<newline/>
shippes ready to de
<image name="par"/>
te for Portesmouth, It was no
<newline/>
yll direction to appoint the States shippes also to come
<newline/>
thither being more forward for the service, and a better
<newline/>
porte to rest in then Dover. You make also an other
<newline/>
dowbt in that the States stood in dowbt whither her
<newline/>
Ma
<super id="1883" replace="jesti">
t
<image name="es"/>
</super>
 resolution continewed, because there followed a coun-
<newline/>
termaunde to Caron, w
<super id="1880" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 indeade had not continewaunce
<newline/>
6 howers, for immediately M
<super id="1888" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Caron was niewlie
<newline/>
required to proceede in the first direction notw
<super id="1891" replace="ith">

you in my l

Furthermore where I did alledge, what the States

 de Caron of the xxix

<newline/>
I will still avowe yt so to be reported by M

r

 Caron,
<newline/>
not onely to me but to the Quene, and howsoever the
<newline/>

<super id="1947" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 shewing a copie of
<newline/>
their l
<overline id="1919" replace="ettre">
re
</overline>
 sent to Caron, I do rayther presume to
<newline/>
credit Caron then their copie of their l
<overline id="1916" replace="ettre">
re
</overline>
, in that
<newline/>
I fynde them unwilling to doo this service, w
<super id="1928" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is to
<newline/>
so good a purpose, as though her Ma
<super id="1925" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 had not pressed
<newline/>
them thereto, they ought to have offred yt and not
<newline/>
w
<super id="1932" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 these trifling aunsweres to delay yt as they have
<newline/>
donne, and so yt appeareth their unwillingnes. And
<newline/>
where they seeme to stande still uppon the dowbt of
<newline/>
the countermaunde I am assured that Caron was ad-
<newline/>
vertised w
<super id="1941" replace="ith">
th
</super>
in 6 howres after the countermaund was
<newline/>
given, that he should proceede as at the first he
<newline/>
was directed, and so he did w
<super id="1950" replace="ith">
th
</super>
in a day or two after
<newline/>
promyse to wryte unto the States, and I do beleve
<newline/>
he did 
<image name="par"/>
fourme his promyse: but in this matter I
<newline/>
see plainly the tryfling of the States, and unwillingnes
<newline/>
whatsoever they give owt in words for now (as you
<newline/>
<folioref id="1958">
fol.225r
</folioref>
 wryte) when you moove them for 30 last
<image name="es"/>
 of powder
<newline/>
they make you no good aunsweare thereunto, but
<newline/>
differre it untill all the Deputies of the States be
<newline/>
come togither, so as I see howsoever you have bin
<newline/>
lately instructed or not thoroughly, yet when you
<newline/>
are both instructed, and deale w
<super id="1968" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 them in a point
<newline/>
necessary you can get no aunsweare.
