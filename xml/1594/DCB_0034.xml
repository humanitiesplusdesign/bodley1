Maye it please your good L: I have nothing more to signifie for myne
<newline/>

 had fully resolved,
<newline/>
I might either have knowne, by some little intimation, wherupon 
<newline/>
it hath stayed, or had somewhat saide unto me, to intertayne
<newline/>
them heere the whyle: For although I have devised the beste 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
I could to aunswear their demandes, yet I see they are 
<insertion id="0382">
not

 satisfied, and
<newline/>
I am alwayes uncerten, how well my aunswers maye accorde with

<newline/>
Campe, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e fift of this moneth, a parte of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Ravelin where our
<newline/>
soldiers had mined, and placed stoare of powder, was sette a fyre,
<newline/>
and blowen up, with 200 men in it, of which there were very
<newline/>
fewe saved, but either by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Mine or by our men after slaine, and
<newline/>
manie of 
<image name="thorn"/>
em drowned in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e water fast by. The Ravelin there-
<newline/>
upon was presently assaulted, and taken by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Scottes, whose quar-
<newline/>
ter was neerest, which is thought a great stoppe to

e taking of

as in

The weather heere for this moneth hath been exceeding wette,
