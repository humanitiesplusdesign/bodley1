strained this yere more then ever before, to contri-

sed w

 very great earnestnesse, alleging divers

other reasons, but concluded in substance in the

 I endevoured to avoide by urging

e

importance of succouring

festing to them, that

before this of their present exploit, and

at aswell

in respect of

e trafficke of their people, as of
<newline/>
her Ma

<newline/>
the Enemie at this p

 is farre weaker in field,
<newline/>
then he hath bin these many yeres, and

<image name="thorn"/>
e companies
<newline/>
demaunded might be spared well enough, and no
<newline/>
suche danger come of it, as they did pretend.
<newline/>
But in conclusion, upon shewe

tisfaction, howsoever I replied, although it were with
