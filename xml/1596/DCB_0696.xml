</place>
 simulation and cunning:
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state of their affaires, since he and I talked,
<newline/>
had bin notablely changed: and that the College of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>

<newline/>
mater (albeyt he did not thinke, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they knewe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
particularities) so as nowe the second tyme to intermed-
<newline/>
dle in the same, it was to hasard overmuche his cre-
<newline/>
dit in the Contrey, if it should not succeede to their
<newline/>
generall lyking: which he had no reason to put in
<newline/>
adventure, sith it touched him no more then every
<newline/>
man besydes. This was so in debate for 2 dayes
<newline/>
together: but yet in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e ende, with very muche a doe,
<newline/>
and in many sortes of persuasions, he made me this
<newline/>
answear, That although it were apparant, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at sins
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e tyme of that ouverture, there had many thinges
<newline/>
hapned heere, which were evident impeachements
<newline/>
to the course 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he proposed, yet he continued in his
<newline/>
hope, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at to stand in good assurance of her

<super id="0073" replace="jesties">

a

des
<newline/>
the Contrey might be drawen to yelde to some offer
<newline/>
beyond their abilitie: wherein he would take paines
<newline/>
to satisfie her Ma
<super id="0079" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 by all the wayes he could invent:
<newline/>
howsoever there had passed just occasion of discou-
<newline/>
ragement: but yet it was not in his power to finde
<newline/>
so ready meanes, to attaine to that he would,
<newline/>
<folioref id="0083">
fol.97v
</folioref>
 as when it was integrum. For which it would be
<newline/>
behoofull to have a litle patience, till his fellowes might
<newline/>
be wrought by convenient degrees, to allowe the proposal.
<newline/>
It was also to be thought on, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he of all others, might
<newline/>
not nowe, as at first propounde, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater in their

<newline/>
it once a foote, I should see every daye by his care-
<newline/>
full proceeding, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he forslowed no occasion, to second

me soundly. Wherupon I tould him, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at my Co
<overline id="0112" replace="mm">
m

<newline/>
would not beare, 
<image name="thorn"/>

</super>
 but yet I would adven-
<newline/>
ture after tyme, as I had uttered her pleasure unto
<newline/>
them, to cast out a worde in general termes, by
<newline/>
way of proposing any privat opinion, and with a 
<newline/>
true protestation, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I had no Co

m
</overline>
ission from her
<newline/>
Ma
<super id="0121" replace="jestie">

</super>
 to doe it, to suche effect as this, That I had
<newline/>
weighed with my self, very often and throughly,
<newline/>
as muche as they could alleage, in excuse of their
<newline/>
refusals, and that I sawe notwithstanding, how
<newline/>
backward soever they had shewed themselves, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
they might easelie devise, to satisfie her Ma
<super id="0142" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 and
<newline/>
make no dangerous diminution of the strength
<newline/>
and welfare of the Contrey: and if after upon this,
<newline/>
in their privat consultation, he would take a fitte occa-
<newline/>
sion, to provoke his Collegues to a conference, and to send
<newline/>
some two or three, to knowe the meanes that I could [plott]
<newline/>
to give her Hig

breake the ice unto his handes, and reco

would not so give it over, but when the season served

for it, they might be troubled with the fruites of a

<image name="thorn"/>

<image name="thorn"/>

by some notable do

 To that which I declared in her Ma

me this answear, That they mervailed out of mea-

<newline/>
in their l

at she would have given way to their true alle-

occasion might be offered, I should knowe their reso-

of mine owne proper motion, they tooke it as procee-

<newline/>
to make a crooked arrowe streight: for w

e soonest he could, and travel to effect
<newline/>
it w
<super id="0363" replace="ith">

Collegues whould be urged very hastely, he thought
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at out of question, they would either not give [eare]
<newline/>
or if they should, and should not lyke it, it were ra[ther]
<newline/>
more to be renued. Wheruopn he would endevor not
