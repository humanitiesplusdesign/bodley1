<newline/>
conjecture. And, to proceed in other sort it will but
<newline/>
irritat their myndes, and not procure you that successe
<newline/>
as yow peradventure may expect. I had had
<newline/>
litle thankes in mine owne conceat, had I done as yo

fitte to impart it out of hand, and you to use yo

 though I for

caried to
