serve, for a very litle inducement, to drawe them

to doe

at, which 
<image name="thorn"/>
e project did intend, and
<newline/>
M
<super id="0353" replace="aster">

 Barnevelt would prosecute. For if I had

concurred w
<super id="0350" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e very same plotte, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he had formerly
<newline/>
proposed, at his being in 
<place id="2314" place_id="Zierickzee">
Zyricksea,
</place>
 because it
<newline/>
might have happened 
<image name="thorn"/>
at some heere of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States,
<newline/>
had bin secretly told it, by some frind of that
<newline/>
conference, it would have wrought a great
<newline/>
suspition of intelligence between us, and thereby
<newline/>
<folioref id="0357">
fol.40v
</folioref>
 bredde some other jalousies, then were to be neglected
<newline/>
In w
<super id="0365" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 respect I thought it meete, to varie somew
<super id="0362" replace="hat">
at
</super>
<newline/>
from him, and because it was but done, to serve 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
present turne, I hold it as impertinment, to be rela-
<newline/>
ted to yo
<super id="0392" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. But of

e progresse, and

e substance,
<newline/>
of that w
<super id="0389" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I negotiat, I will not comitte, any ne-
<newline/>
cessarie circumstance: having brought it already
<newline/>
to a very good passe, in that the assembly of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
States is seased of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater, at their owne requi-
<newline/>
sition. For hardly would yo
<super id="0383" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. beleeve of their
<newline/>
humo
<super id="0386" replace="">

</super>
, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they should be so nice and delicat to
<newline/>
deale w
<super id="0405" replace="ith">
t
</super>
: in so muche as if at first I had poured
<newline/>
out at once, all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e pointes of my Ouverture, however
<newline/>
I had qualified my speeches unto them, w
<super id="0402" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 appa-
<newline/>
rances of profit to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e State of their Contrey, it would
<newline/>
undoubtedly have astonied and not persuaded
<newline/>
them 
<deletion id="0409">
all
</deletion>
 
<insertion id="0412">
a whitte
</insertion>
: so as I doubt the very motion would
<newline/>
have dashed it self, at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e very first [occurrence],
<newline/>
and there afer, their good liking, to listen unto it,
<newline/>
would have growen irrecouverable. For every nou-
<newline/>
veltie unto them, where 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater is of weight, is
<newline/>
greatly suspected: and I doe plainely perceave it,
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at they have ever some distrust of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e English pro-
<newline/>
eedinges, howe cleerely soever we may deale in
<newline/>
our causes, w
<super id="0452" replace="hich">

 puttes me often to my shiftes, howe
<newline/>
to speake or to treat w
<super id="0449" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 any one of them all.
<newline/>
But yet in this negotiation I have spedde beyond
<newline/>
my hope, of a favorable issue, for as farre as I have
<newline/>
brought it, and for so short a poursuite. I may
<newline/>
imagine very safely upon this their deputation, and
<newline/>
by divers tokens otherwise, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it is not yet surmised
<newline/>
that there passeth in secret any special correspon-
<newline/>
dence between me and M
<super id="0443" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Barnevelt. W
<super id="0446" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is a very

great helpe, both to him and to me, for
