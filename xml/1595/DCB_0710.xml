thereunto and to my generall proposition, about the

<newline/>
nothing sayed to that effect, as when I writte you
<newline/>
my last the 13 of this present, I well hoped to have
<newline/>
heard in regard of a further offer, of some actual sa-

tisfaction to be made unto her Ma

 for although
<newline/>
they were in talke, how somewhat might be done, yet

doubting in part, howe the contrey would perfourme
<newline/>
it, and partly also howe her Ma
<super id="0048" replace="jestie">

</super>
 would accept of
<newline/>
a litle, they grewe to no conclusion. All their
<newline/>
aunswear in a maner, some certaine pointes excepted,

is

 more can be added nowe

unto it. Againe I am persuaded that nothing

will prevaile, whatsoever I say besides; because

I suppose to be no lesse, then they seeme to insinuat.

<newline/>
For there have bin some comitted, to take parti-

<newline/>
often tymes debated this mater of my message, and

were exceedingly perplexed in devising how to deale,
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at both her Ma

busied, as never soe much in any other mater, yet
<newline/>
they found it impossible, to doe 
<image name="thorn"/>
at which was requy-
<newline/>
red, and they thought very muche to be pressed
<newline/>
unto it. We doe all, say they, confesse, that we are
<newline/>
bound to her Ma

</super>
 next to God, for this shewe
<newline/>
of assurance wherto our Contrey is reduced: for which
<newline/>
it dooth not becomme us to contest with her in wordes,
<newline/>
about 
<image name="thorn"/>
e equitie of our cause, but yet to say as
<newline/>
the trueth is, and every man knowes, we are farre
<newline/>
from that Tranquillitie, whereupon we concluded our

at neither she

e

preface thereunto doth expresse very plainely, to
<newline/>
contract for a lesser aide then 5000 foote and a

2000 horse. For we knowe a lesse number would

but drawe our warres at lenght, and cause the

people to despayre, when they saw

no other, but a soddaine composition and agreement

 of her Ma
<super id="0219" replace="jesties">

</super>
 Companies to the service
<newline/>
of the fielde. These and other lyke
<newline/>
speeches were delivered unto me by word of mouthe,
<newline/>
but in very humble tearmes, and duetifull sorte.
<newline/>
To make your L. partaker of my answears againe,
<newline/>
were to troble you indiscretly w
<super id="0261" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 a tedious recital.
<newline/>
But after I had spoken w
<super id="5478" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 was meete for her Ma
<super id="0258" replace="jestie">

</super>

<newline/>
I lette them understande 
<image name="thorn"/>
at wordes and writinges
<newline/>
were good cheape, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at needes they must deter-
<newline/>
mine to make some other payment. For though
<newline/>
their state was not so good, as was co
<overline id="0255" replace="mm">
m
</overline>
only suppo-
<newline/>
sed, they were not yet to seeke of a competent meanes
<newline/>
to gratifie her Ma
<super id="0252" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
. And if they should not
<newline/>
by somewhat shewe their thanckfulnes unto her, I
<newline/>
doubted of the sequele, in regard of her displeasure:
<newline/>
But whatsoever I could alleage they were wonder-
<newline/>
full vehement in all their protestations, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they
<newline/>
were destitute of meanes to satsifie her Hig
<super id="0281" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
, and
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at they could yelde unto her only

e
<newline/>
of a hundred thousand powndes, w
<super id="0278" replace="hich">

requyre to be payed every yere; but not a farre
<newline/>
<folioref id="0275">
fol.104v
</folioref>
 lesser summe, without incurring the perill of their
<newline/>
utter confusion. And where they understood
<newline/>
that I meant to convey their aunswear to her Ma
<super id="0310" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
and not to cary it my self, as they had imagined
<newline/>
I would soone after it was delivered in writing
<newline/>
unto me, they sent of purpose to calle me to
<newline/>
their publicke assemblie, and there they intreated
<newline/>
or rather conjured me (they spake with suche
<newline/>
affection) that in a mater of that moment, wherein
<newline/>
soe muche depended for her Ma
<super id="0307" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 good aswell as
<newline/>
theirs, I would take the paines my self to returne
<newline/>
w

<super id="0301" replace="jestie">

</super>

<newline/>
onely those reasons, w
<super id="0298" replace="hich">

<newline/>
but sith I knowe in lyke maner, howe it stoode
<newline/>
w
<super id="0361" replace="ith">

</super>
 these contreis, acquaint her also of my selfe
<newline/>
directly, and sincerely, w
<super id="0358" replace="ith">

</super>
 the full estate of their

at in every particular, w
<super id="0355" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 could
<newline/>
not be expressed to be perfectly conceaved but by
<newline/>
verbal demonstration: which would cause her
<newline/>
they were certaine, to runne some other course,
<newline/>
then suche as might occasion the flatte subversion
<newline/>
of the Contrey. They would willingly
<newline/>
have sent some Deputie of their owne, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
it could not be done without writing to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Provin-
<newline/>
ces, w
<super id="0352" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 would but make a longe worke, and was
<newline/>
not so convenient. Having made my excuse by
<newline/>
dyvers causes, but chiefly for want of her Ma
<super id="0349" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
<newline/>
licence, they urged me so earnestly and promised
<newline/>
me to write so effectually unto her, as I should
<newline/>
not neede to doubt, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it would be well con-
<newline/>
strued. At w
<super id="0346" replace="hich">

at heere I can doe litle,

till I see howe her Hig

</super>
 will proceede upon their

aunswear, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I may at her pleasure returne

againe assoone as any messenger, I have thought

it fittest for her service not to stand upon deniall.
