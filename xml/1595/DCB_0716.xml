 good L. It is nowe ten dayes

 And sins I have
<newline/>
observed,

at both they and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e rest have bin
<newline/>
dyvers tymes together, to consult upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e maters
<newline/>
in so muche as I supposed, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at either they
<newline/>
before this, would have sent for me unto
<newline/>
their College, or deputed some to tell me, to 
<newline/>
what effect they had resolved. But being
<newline/>
secretly informed that they had varied in
<newline/>
opinions, and surceased for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e tyme to
<newline/>
deliberat upon it, I requested to have au-
<newline/>
dience in their publicke meeting, where I
<newline/>
put them in remembrance of all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e course
<newline/>
of my proceeding in this negotiation: howe
<newline/>
long it had bin, sins 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater was proposed:
<newline/>
howe many l
<overline id="1149" replace="ettres">

</overline>
 her 
<person id="1667" person_id="Elizabeth">
Hig
<super id="1146" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
</person>
 had written unto
<newline/>
them: and howe great occasions were presen-
<newline/>
ted, that she might worthelie disdaine this
<newline/>
long delaieng of their aunswear: w
<super id="1670" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 suche
<newline/>
other allegations, as fitted that argument.
<newline/>
Wherto their speeches returned were so vehement,
<newline/>
and earnest, and full of solemne protestations,
<newline/>
as I can not calle to minde, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I have heard
<newline/>
them at any tyme doe the lyke heeretofore.
<newline/>
For of all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e troublesome accidents, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at hapned
<newline/>
among them, sins 
<image name="thorn"/>
e union of their 
<place id="1673" place_id="United Provinces">
Provinces,
</place>
<newline/>
they affirmed very constantly, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at there had not
<newline/>
and at any tyme either busied them longer,
<newline/>
or grieved them more, or caried so muche
<newline/>
danger, if it were not well conducted, as this
<newline/>
proposal of her Ma
<super id="1140" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
. For w
<super id="1143" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they urged me
<newline/>
exceedingly, to move her Hig
<super id="1137" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
 to consider
<newline/>
the composition of their gouvernment, the
<newline/>
humor of

 affaires, w
<super id="1185" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 in a cause of this nature, would by
<newline/>
no meanes admitte a speedier dispatche. They
<newline/>
had sent, they sayed, of purpose, to

e Councel
<newline/>
of Estate, to require their advise upon her Ma
<super id="1182" replace="jesties">

</super>
<newline/>
demaunde: w
<super id="1179" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 had already bin reported by
<newline/>
their Deputies unto them, but it prooved so de-
<newline/>
fective, as they were ayded nothing by yt: for

w
<super id="1176" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they had resolved, to send their l
<overline id="1173" replace="ettres">
res
</overline>
 out
<newline/>
of hand, to request their presence at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Hage,
<newline/>
so that they hoped very shortly, to come in con-
<newline/>
ference teogether, and then to growe to some con-
<newline/>
clusions w
<super id="1170" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 was

e effect of all their answear:
<newline/>
though I did my best endevo
<super id="1243" replace="">
r
</super>
, to drawe them
<newline/>
by persuasion, to some present resolution.
<newline/>
For my privat opinion of the sequele of this
<newline/>

<newline/>
formerly declared, by my l

<newline/>
nothing to be heard, but complaints of all handes
<newline/>

<newline/>
token of allowance, or favor in this mater.
<newline/>
The enemies Campe and ours are still together
