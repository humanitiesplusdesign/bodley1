t

 his
<newline/>
principals heere, his endevors in Conclusion will
<newline/>
all come to nothing. For where it is required 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
some order may be taken for a just reduction of their
<newline/>
coines to their estimat and value, it was done by
<newline/>
their Placart in

<newline/>
to speake upon knowledge, I see 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states are very
<newline/>
carefull, to have their
 ordinance observed, and they
<newline/>
wryte very strictly to their officers about it, But yet
<newline/>
they can not so provide but abuses will creepe in, as in
<newline/>
all other States 
<image name="thorn"/>
e lyke doth dailie happen: and sooner
<newline/>
happilie heere w
