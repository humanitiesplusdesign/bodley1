<newline/>
(as I have alwayes thought they would) to

had no meaning to satisfie her Hig

happelie determine to send some Deputies unto

her to deliver their excuses, they should alter

<newline/>
for so I had bin willed to signifie unto them.
<newline/>
This was taken muche to harte,

<super id="0658" replace="jestie">

</super>
<newline/>

<newline/>
dayes together, w
<super id="0655" replace="hat">
at

 course to take upon it.
<newline/>
For to forbeare to send at all, they thought it
<newline/>
might be taken for a weake resolution, sith they
<newline/>
could not by theyr l
<overline id="0652" replace="ettres">

 make so cleere a demon-

stration of their want of readie meanes, to

<newline/>
And yet to send upon presumption when they

had bin by me forewarned to refraine, and so
<newline/>
perhaps when they came to be rejected of her

Ma

a doe there hath bin as I am told by some among

howe they will conclude; albeyt by all conjecture

unto them some other forme of Treatie, they might

did insinuat, that as farre as I could learne,
<newline/>
if any thing were obtained, it must come by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
meanes of a newe Accord. But of any resolution
<newline/>
either taken or intended to be taken about it, I

am utterly ignorant. For as occasions may be

given, if they chance to send their Deputies,
<newline/>
<folioref id="0788">
fol.78v

 they are lyke enough in secret to conclude other maters

England, to autorise them to deale, as any motion
<newline/>
to their liking shall happen to proceede from her

<newline/>
with her Hig
<super id="0867" replace="hnes">

 and will shunne it, as they may,
<newline/>
in all duetifull sort, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie may not

triumph, and turne it to his benefitte: but if 
<newline/>
she force them unto it, by her publicke protesta-

justefie themselves in

to notifie to all men, w

t
</super>
 what patience they

have boaren the breaches of

will proceede to deprive them of her aide, they must,

and will provide to trust unto themselves, and to

<newline/>
in her speeches of

med often so to build upon

e affections of this people
<newline/>
as if 
<image name="thorn"/>

by remonstrance to refourme and disavowe

<newline/>
somew

 forme of gouvernment. But for these 6 or 7 yeares:
<newline/>
I have found 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people very willing, to be guided by
<newline/>
their Deputies, who are also very warie, to knowe
<newline/>
howe farre they may presume. For though somew
<super id="0908" replace="hat">
at

<newline/>
sometymes be done by their Deputies against their

<newline/>
that there was anie thing controlled or counter-
<newline/>
manded by

<newline/>
Which is the patience they will use, for preservation
