and till all

e Deputies be mette, they can take no resolution
<newline/>
upon my proposition. It is feared very much that some
<newline/>
alteration of thinges at home hath stayed their commming,
<newline/>
or at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e least their present passadge: by reasons of the great

 For in proceeding with these Provinces, the King hath gone

by suche degrees, to winne upon their amitie, as I feare

<newline/>
I will not trouble your L. with long rehersall of my
<newline/>
answers and other speeches betweene us: but in effect they
<newline/>
were to pray him, to pardon my refusall, unles my warrant
<newline/>
were better. For said I, to speake of maters roundly and
<newline/>
famililarly between us, I may very well presume upon the
<newline/>
reasons you alleage, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at her Ma
<super id="0774" replace="jestie">

</super>
 would be willing to

advance

will soe much mislike of his forme of proceeding, as she
<newline/>
would have 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States made acquainted with her manifold
<newline/>
endevors to free the K. of his troubles. Let it be as yow
<newline/>
give out, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at his State is reduced to pointes of extremitie,
<newline/>
wherof I know very little either one way or other (though
<newline/>
there be

<image name="thorn"/>
at both his perill is not suche,
<newline/>
and 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
howe can you reporte it heere, but they will p
<overline id="0807" replace="resent">
nt

ly aske 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
question, why, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King having soe largely and soe long
<newline/>
tasted of her Ma
<super id="0804" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 bountie, and the danger beyng neere
<newline/>
to England then to them, he should not rather in this

case, have recourse unto her Hig

es
</super>
, or at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e least make
<newline/>
her privie, and request her advise, before he sent to move
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e States? In your answear heere unto I know not
<newline/>
how you will acquyte your selfe: but yow must without
<newline/>
offence give me leave to suspect, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at yow will speake very
<newline/>
little in her Ma
<super id="0823" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 behalf, but rather secretly complayne
<newline/>
in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e maneging of your businesse, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at she hath not, or will
<newline/>
not doe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e part of a neighbor, w
<super id="0820" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 may be soe amplified in
<newline/>
places where you come, as I doubt it may alsoe tende, to
<newline/>
worke some alienation in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e hartes of this people, from their
<newline/>
devotion to her Hig
<super id="0846" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
. And these are suche suspitions,
<newline/>
or causes of suspitions, as they force me to forbeare, and not
<newline/>
to meddle of or on, unles I had co
<overline id="0843" replace="mm">

ission. And therfore
<newline/>
onely as before, I wish

.
<newline/>
<newline/>
As a man touched neere and guiltie, as it seemed of some
