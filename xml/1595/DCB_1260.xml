yet I rest as uncertaine as when I came hither.
<newline/>
But if I should imparte my private conjecture,
<newline/>
as I can not well perceave,

at their state is sufficient
<newline/>
to give her

I doubt, if it were, there will nothing be obtained,

but by a newe Treatie. For this I finde to be a reason
<newline/>
