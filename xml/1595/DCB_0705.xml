 May it please your good L. Till 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Deputies be re-
<newline/>
turned from 
<person id="5794" person_id="Maurice">
Co. Maurice
</person>
 and

<person id="5797" person_id="Council of State">
Councel,
</person>
 (w
<super id="1354" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
<newline/>
is expected every houre) I shall have no other
<newline/>
mater, to imparte unto your L. about mine owne
<newline/>
negotiation, then hath bin formerly advertised.
<newline/>
For all 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I can yet signifie is by way of con-
<newline/>
jecture, and by collecting heere and there, by
<newline/>
privat mens speeches, howe my message wilbe
<newline/>
taken, when it cometh to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e multitude. Wherein
<newline/>
to make report, how I finde them yet inclined,
<newline/>
I never sawe lesse apparance of a good answear
<newline/>
towardes. To be pressed to acknowledge 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Treatie is expired, they may by no meanes
<newline/>
endure: much lesse to be required to make anie
<newline/>
remboursement, in which respect they also pleade
<newline/>
extreme unabilitie. And though it were not so
<newline/>
great as they give it out, but that their State might
<newline/>
affourd some present good portion, yet there are
<newline/>
of them that say, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at to obtaine it of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Contrey,
<newline/>
they must fitte their persuasions according to their
<newline/>
humors, and as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people may disgest it: and
<newline/>
that is by proposing some other new Treatie,
<newline/>
under colo
<super id="1348" replace="">
r
</super>
 thereof to drawe somew
<super id="1351" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 from them,
<newline/>
and not by clayming it directly by force of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
former Contract, which appointed no paiment
<newline/>
till 
<image name="thorn"/>
e ende of their warres. Moreover I per-
<newline/>
ceave by circumstance of talke, that their bent
<newline/>
is altogether, to send unto her 
<person id="5801" person_id="Elizabeth">
Ma
<super id="1345" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
</person>
 some
<newline/>
principal persons, to declare by worde of mouth
<newline/>
a flatte impossibilitie, as their state standeth
<newline/>
yet, to accomplishe her demande: but whether
<newline/>
withall they will determine upon making any
<newline/>
ouverture, of some other kinde of Treatie, it is
<newline/>
more then I can ghesse by their speeches unto 
<newline/>
me. For my self I goe forward in urging
<newline/>
<folioref id="1342">
fol.2v
</folioref>
 them to 
<image name="thorn"/>
at w
<super id="1447" replace="hich">

<newline/>
them w
<super id="1444" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 I can, from all other plottes and courses
<newline/>
of their owne. Nevertheles I thought it meete, to
<newline/>
foresignifie these conjectures, because it may be 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
your L. may turne it to some profitte, in

e Towne of 
<place id="5804" place_id="Cambrai">
Cambray,
</place>
 is very much hearkened
<newline/>
after, by all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people of this Contrey: who are
<newline/>
pressed very hard, to helpe the 
<person id="5807" person_id="Navarre">

</person>
 out of hand,
<newline/>
w
<super id="1438" replace="ith">

 some stoare of foote Companies: not at all, as
<newline/>
I heare, by any l

,

e 
<person id="5813" person_id="Turin">

<newline/>
and others. Wherein there should not neede any spe-
<newline/>
cial intreatie, if 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie heere w
<super id="1429" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 us were not
<newline/>
lodged so neere, as they can not for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e present spare
<newline/>
that succo
<super id="1426" replace="">

</super>
 as they would. Nevertheles 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States have
<newline/>
accorded, if Co. Maurice at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Campe finde no reason
<newline/>
against it, to send suche nombers for 
<image name="thorn"/>
at service,
<newline/>
as I thincke will amount to 2000 at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e least:
<newline/>
because they holde it as a place of extraordinarie
<newline/>
consequence for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state of these 
<place id="5816" place_id="United Provinces">
Provinces.
</place>
<newline/>
<newline/>
For if it be relieved, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie beaten from it,
<newline/>
it will abate his reputation, and weaken him other
<newline/>
wise, to his very geat prejudice: but if for want
<newline/>
of assistance the towne should be surrendred, both
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e credit of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Spaniard, and the courage of their
<newline/>
armie, together w
<super id="1423" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 their meanes, to endomage these
<newline/>
contreis, wilbe greater then ever. And for cer-
<newline/>
taine we shall finde, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at shortly upon it, that
<newline/>
those of 
<place id="5819" place_id="Artois">
Artois
</place>
 and 
<place id="5822" place_id="Hainault">
Henault
</place>
 will contribut very lar-
<newline/>
gely to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e conquest of those places, that lie upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Some, as 
<place id="5825" place_id="Amiens">
Amiens,
</place>
 
<place id="5828" place_id="Abbeville">
Abbeville,
</place>
 and others: albeit some
<newline/>
men thincke, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they will presently to 
<place id="5831" place_id="Calais">
Calais.
</place>
<newline/>
<newline/>
But this is feared most of all by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e chiefest of them
<newline/>
heere, in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e F. Kinges proceedinges, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at if the Enemie
<newline/>
<folioref id="1420">
fol.3r
</folioref>
 should speede in his p
<overline id="1514" replace="resent">
nt
</overline>
 attempt, it will force
<newline/>
him in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e end to grow in amitie with 
<place id="5834" place_id="Spain">
Spaine.
</place>
<newline/>
For their thinke that for him 
<image name="thorn"/>
at hath already
<newline/>
leapt over such blockes of offence, with such
<newline/>
notable case to obtaine a kingdome full of
<newline/>
trouble, it were but scrupulositie, when his
<newline/>
state is somwhat desperat, to make a stoppe
<newline/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e leaving of his neighbors in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e briars,
<newline/>
to enjoy all his kingdome in peaceable maner.
<newline/>
<newline/>
And though it may be replied, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Spa-
<newline/>
niard hath no reason, to falle to termes of
<newline/>
peace in a case of such advantage, and
<newline/>
when the shewe is so faire, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King may
<newline/>
be subdued by some other endevors: yet this
<newline/>
is thought by these men heere, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at when he
<newline/>
findes by 
<image name="thorn"/>
at meanes 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he may readilie re-
<newline/>
cover 
<image name="thorn"/>
e possession of these Provinces, both
<newline/>
a peace will be proposed, and as plausible con-
<newline/>
ditions, as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King can desire. And if they
<newline/>
chance to be embraced, either 
<place id="5838" place_id="France">
France
</place>
 must
<newline/>
be 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Instrument, to persuade with these
<newline/>
contreys to come to some agreement, or 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Enemie of himself, and by meanes of his 
<newline/>
greatnesse, will compasse his dessigne.
<newline/>
For when his armies are together, which are nowe
<newline/>
so farre a sunder, he shall easely be
<newline/>
able to assault at one instant, so many of their
<newline/>
townes, as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e force of this Contrey wilbe farre
<newline/>
insufficient to make head against him.
<newline/>
And what in such an exigent, will become of 
<newline/>
their courage, when they see themselves redu-
<newline/>
ced to their first poore Estate, and when their
<newline/>
ancient ringleaders, suche as hated 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Spaniard
<newline/>
not as nowe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e younger sorte, because they
<newline/>
<folioref id="1511">
fol.3v
</folioref>
 heare of his tirannie, but because they sawe
<newline/>
and felt it in their persons and goods are
<newline/>
almost all consumed, it is greatly to be 
<newline/>
doubted. The more a great deale, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
hitherto they have used by turnes the helpe
<newline/>
of all their neighbors, and those of dyvers
<newline/>
nations, and are perhaps within themselves
<newline/>
distasted of them all, whereby it may be
<newline/>
feared, that when they knowe not heereafter
<newline/>
to whome to have recourse, they will ra-
<newline/>
ther adventure upon a fraudulent accord,
<newline/>
then fight without hope of any ende of
<newline/>
their miseries. Howseover in such a 
<newline/>
case they may chance to be affected, the doubt
<newline/>
of this agreement betweene the two kinges,
<newline/>
hath bin ever in a maner the principal
<newline/>
motive, to sett them forward in this contrey,
<newline/>
to support 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
