 good L. when I came to

M

 Valke
</person>
, with whome
<newline/>
I thought it not amisse, to beginne in this order. I
<newline/>
told him

at her 
<person id="1091" person_id="Elizabeth">
Ma
<super id="0416" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
</person>
 had enjoined me expressely, to

salute him in her name, and to will him to remember,
<newline/>
what he had signified unto her, about 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Amitie conclu-
<newline/>
ded at his being in 
<place id="1094" place_id="Scotland">
Scotland.
</place>
 She had occasion to
<newline/>
conjecture, that somwhat els aswell as that, was ether
<newline/>
then contrived, or would be very shortly, when 
<person id="1097" person_id="Stewart, Colonel">
Coronel
<newline/>
Stuart
</person>
 should come hither: albeit she had no doubt, but

M

r
</super>
 Valke for his particular would never yelde to any
<newline/>
practise, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at might turne to her detriment. But if
<newline/>
in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e end it proved otherwise, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e inconvenience of
<newline/>
suche dealinges would falle upon these contreis, and
<newline/>
perhaps so great a part would light upon his shoulders,
<newline/>
as they would not be able to welde 
<image name="thorn"/>
e weight of that
<newline/>
bourden, as bigge, and as large, and as strong as they
<newline/>
were: w
<super id="0440" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I told him w
<super id="0443" replace="ith">
t
</super>
all she uttered very merely.
<newline/>
For suche a kinde of salutation I thought might

fitte very well w

he tooke it in good part, w

 humble thankes unto her

Hig

<newline/>
yet w
<super id="0472" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 earnest protestation, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at nothing had passed
<newline/>
between 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="1100" person_id="James VI">
Scottish King

 and them, but a general

revocation of

e ancient leagues and alliances between
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<deletion id="1103">
towne

 two contreis. And if any thing els should
<newline/>
be sought at their handes, he was flatte of opinion, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
they were not to embrace it in honestie, or pollicie:
<newline/>
considering w
<super id="0466" replace="hat">

 and howe mightie she was, if she would be re-
<newline/>
venged: and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at in Scotland they sawe nothing but
<newline/>
beggerie, wantes, and weakenesse. He also added
<newline/>
other reasons too long 
<insertion id="0490">
to
</insertion>
 relate, but in one among 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
rest, he utterly disliked, to see so many youthes about

also, as he thought, to goe from hens into

</place>
<newline/>
I tooke occasion heereup

<newline/>
they did in those cases, w

t
</super>
out acquainting her Ma
<super id="0544" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 with
<newline/>
their purpose before. For said I to tell yow plainely,
<newline/>
we are thus persuaded of Scottes in 
<place id="1115" place_id="England">
England,
</place>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they
<newline/>
are naturaly inclined to dissimulation and cunning,
<newline/>
and are full of inconstancie: and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at w
<super id="0572" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 yow in good
<newline/>
meaning may be wonne to graunt unto them, will
<newline/>
peradventure be abused to yo
<super id="0569" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 very great preudice.
<newline/>
It might be also in continuance, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they would falle to

e King, w
<super id="0566" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 if
<newline/>
in every point she have not applied to their humou-
<newline/>
rous dispositions, they would undoubtedly disgrace, and
<newline/>
happely seeke to drawe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states to a like dislike of her
<newline/>
proceedinges. Wherew
<super id="0583" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 I made some rehersall, howe
<newline/>
highly 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King was beholding to her Ma
<super id="0580" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 and howe
<newline/>
unkindly for his part he had requited it hitherto:
<newline/>
concluding therupon, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at if 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King and these contreis
<newline/>
should joine in any action against her Ma
<super id="0617" replace="jesties">

</super>
 good li-
<newline/>

<newline/>
it were caried for

<super id="0614" replace="jesties">

</super>
 puis-
<newline/>
sance, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Love 
<image name="thorn"/>
at is borne by her subjectes unto her,
<newline/>
being duly considered, it was easie to foresee, howe soone
<newline/>
she might be able, to meete w
<super id="0611" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 his designes, and so pulle
<newline/>
downe 
<image name="thorn"/>
at saile wherunto he trusteth most. And as for
<newline/>
these contreis, she hath gotten in her custodie their cau-
<newline/>
tionarie townes, w
<super id="0608" replace="hich">

</super>
 are 
<image name="thorn"/>
e keies of all their doares,
<newline/>
<folioref id="0605">
fol.16r

 that they can not sturre about their buisnesse, but by

her favo
