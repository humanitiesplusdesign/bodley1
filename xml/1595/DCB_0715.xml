<newline/>
howe I founde them heere affected to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater of
<newline/>
my message. They have delegated sins certaine
<newline/>
persons of their College to repaire to 
<person id="4174" person_id="Maurice">
Co. Maurice
</person>
<newline/>
and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="4177" person_id="Council of State">
Councel of Estate
</person>
, with their advise to
<newline/>
be assisted in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e training of their aunswear,
<newline/>
These, it is thought, will hasten their returne
<newline/>
and be heere againe, I ghesse, within these 8
<newline/>
dayes at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e furthest. In the meane season, if
<newline/>
either my owne endevo
<super id="2075" replace="">

, or the travailes of my
<newline/>
frindes had bin able to discover, to w
<super id="2187" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 kinde
<newline/>
of course they are secretly inclined, I have
<newline/>
used all my meanes, and my uttermost diligence
<newline/>
and yet I rest as uncertaine as when I came
<newline/>
hither. But if I should imparte my privat
<newline/>
conjecture, as I can not well perceave, at their
<newline/>
State is sufficient, to give her 
<person id="4180" person_id="Elizabeth">
Hig
<super id="2072" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
</person>
 contentation
<newline/>
of any good portion, so I doubt if it were, there
<newline/>
will nothing be obtained, but by a newe treatie.
<newline/>
For this I finde to be a reason urged by them
<newline/>
all, and I suppose it will goe currant, when
<newline/>
the mater is referred to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e peoples resolution, That
<newline/>
to yelde any paiment by vertue of 
<image name="thorn"/>
