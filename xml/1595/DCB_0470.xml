As touching my negotiation,

<newline/>
We have assured intelligence from divers places of
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemies contreis, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e vulgar people every where
<newline/>
crie openly out against their miseries, shewing manifest
<newline/>
token 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they desire to be joined to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e rest of this union.
<newline/>
And as farre as I can judge of

if

 thereafter as it is, they are fully bent to intertaine it,
<newline/>
to

e best advant
age of their cause. But whether it
<newline/>
were expedient, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at we should strike at this iron, while
<newline/>
it is hotte, and be 
<image name="thorn"/>
e first 
<image name="thorn"/>

e Enemies
<newline/>

<image name="thorn"/>
at doth rest in deliberation: albeit I doe
<newline/>
perceave 
<image name="thorn"/>
at most men are of mind, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at we should not
<newline/>
sturre in this case, but as occasions are p
<overline id="0563" replace="resent">
nt
</overline>
ed from them
<newline/>
unto us. For this is alleaged for it, That before they
<newline/>
send to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie, in a mater of 
<image name="thorn"/>
at importance, they
<newline/>
must first of force heere at home have recourse to every
<newline/>
Province, to purchase autoritie, whereby it will be impar-
<newline/>
ted to every towne, and so come abroade among 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people,
<newline/>
who, as every man doubtes, may prove so every hedlonge
<newline/>
in suche a plausible motion, as perhaps when they see
<newline/>
it is once sette a foote, they will violently thorowe, w
<super id="0577" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out
<newline/>
regard to their owne securitie. The feare of this hu-
<newline/>
mor in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e multitude, doth stay them from proceeding
<newline/>
as they are otherwise willing. It is comonly
<newline/>
reported
