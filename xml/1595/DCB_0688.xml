 May it please your good L. Upon conference had with

<super id="1287" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Barne-
<newline/>
velt
</person>
 and with some others of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e State, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e advancement of my
<newline/>
service, I see this message of her 
<person id="9151" person_id="Elizabeth">
Ma
<super id="1290" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
</person>
 doth trouble them excee-
<newline/>
dingly. For they seeme very loath to returne a naked answear,
<newline/>
and to give her good content they pleade unabilitie. But their
<newline/>
greatest doubt is this, whether in this conjuncture (as they terme
<newline/>
it) and as the present state standeth, both with them and
<newline/>
the Enemie, and those 
<image name="thorn"/>
at now endevo
<super id="1293" replace="">
r
</super>
 to drawe them to a peace
<newline/>
considering also this yeares contribution is not accorded by the
<newline/>
<place id="9154" place_id="United Provinces">
Provinces,
</place>
 it were convenient to imparte to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people her Ma
<super id="1284" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
<newline/>
demaundes. For they say they can doe nothing without their
<newline/>
approbation, for contenting of her Ma
<super id="1278" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 and to publish unto
<newline/>
them what her Hig
<super id="1275" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
 requireth, they holde it very dangerous in
<newline/>
this p
<overline id="1281" replace="resent">
nt
</overline>
 concurrence of soe sundrie great and weightie affaires.
<newline/>
They have bin often together to determine upon it, but they
<newline/>
are at no conclusion. I expect every day when some shalbe depu-
<newline/>
ted to come in conference with me and by that as I thincke,
<newline/>
I shall ghesse somwhat neere, both how they will frame their p
<overline id="9157" replace="resent">

</overline>
<newline/>
aunswear, and what successe in the ende I am lyke to have.
<newline/>
<newline/>
<person id="9160" person_id="Stewart, Colonel">
Coronel Stuart
</person>
 hath bin with me, and in co
<overline id="9163" replace="mm">
m
</overline>
unication hath
<newline/>
declared that his coming to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="9166" person_id="States General">
States
</person>
 is for no other cause,
<newline/>
but first to renewe an alliance between 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="9169" person_id="James VI">
King
</person>
 and these
<newline/>
Contreis, such as hath bin established in former tymes: second-
<newline/>
ly to acquaint them very throughly with 
<image name="thorn"/>
e present Estate of
<newline/>
<place id="9175" place_id="Scotland">
Scotland:
</place>
 and then lastly to request their advise, together with
<newline/>
their succo
<super id="1312" replace="">
r
</super>
 without proposing wherein, but according to their
<newline/>
power, and soe as they shall finde the necessitie of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King, which
<newline/>
toucheth them in lyke manner, if his Ennemies should prevayle.
<newline/>
and this he pretendes to be a course, which the King is forced to
<newline/>
take. For saith he, sith he cannot be supported by the Q. of
<newline/>
<place id="9178" place_id="England">
England
</place>
 by whome he sawe his Estate but slenderly regarded,
<newline/>
to whome should he seeke but to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people of these Provinces?
<newline/>
Through the helpe of those discourses which I receaved of 
<person id="9181" person_id="Cecil, R">
S
<super id="0240" replace="ir">
r
</super>
 Robert
<newline/>
Cecill
</person>
, I was stoared with good matter to aunswear his complaint
<newline/>
<folioref id="1327">
fol.81v
</folioref>
 which he uttered notwithstanding without any passion, and with a 
<newline/>
preface before, full of duetifull wordes of respect to her Ma
<super id="1350" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
.
<newline/>
Howbeyt I sawe by 
<image name="thorn"/>
at little, and by other conjectures, that he
<newline/>
with other phrases in other Company abroade. I have done w
<super id="1353" replace="hat">
at
</super>
<newline/>
I can to feele the States disposition, to gratefie the King, but
<newline/>
I can not yet perceave that they are bent therunto, not for want
<newline/>
of affection (for undoubtedly 
<image name="thorn"/>
at waye they are forwarde) but if
<newline/>
they will relieve him, it must be only with mony (for men
<newline/>
I am sure they can not spare) which if they had in their Cofers,
<newline/>
or could devise to come by it, I doe not doubt but some good
<newline/>
portion would be graunted her Hig
<super id="1347" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
, and to content the Kinge
<newline/>
besides, there is noe manner of probablitie 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they will any waye
<newline/>
be able. It is also signified by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Coronel unto me, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at to stren-
<newline/>
ghten the League between the King and these Contreis, he hath
<newline/>
in charge to motion a match, between the 
<person id="9184" person_id="Orkney">

<newline/>
saide, he hath no assurance of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e

</place>
 because they have bin

claymed by

e abuse of those of Middlebourgh;
<newline/>
about the Currancie of their monies: for this later point, I
<newline/>
have dealth therin heere, and also at Middleborgh, and it was 
<newline/>
carefully followed by

for

</overline>
end it with
<newline/>
the soonest. For now I am certaine, I should come out of season,
<newline/>
to cause them to assemble for a matter of that qualitie.
<newline/>
And where your L. would be informed of the nombers remay-

 in the Towne. If 
<image name="thorn"/>
e place be so
<newline/>
stronge by nature, as every man reportes, or can be strenghtened
<newline/>
by Arte and industrie, beying situat, as it is, upon soe famous
<newline/>
a river, and in the middest of soe many riche Provinces, it will
<newline/>
undoubtedly be brought to yelde a large revenue, by meanes of 
<newline/>
newe contributions and divers kindes of impositions, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at maye be
<newline/>
raised in tyme upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Contrey, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e River. Moreover the
<newline/>
passadge too and fro, between the Enemie and 
<place id="9220" place_id="Italy">

</place>
 will now in 
<newline/>
a manner be closed up cleane, the sooner, through

<person id="9223" person_id="Turin">
D. of Bouillon
</person>
, who hath his Armie there at hand, within 16
<newline/>
dutche myles. In effect it is thought 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e taking of this place
<newline/>
will cause a great alteration in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e actions of this Contrey, and
<newline/>
I hope it will advaunce that which I am to negotiat.
<newline/>
<newline/>
The defeat of our horsemen, whereof I writte in my laste, hath
<newline/>
bin verified unto us, but there were no more, (as now we are ad-
<newline/>
vertised but 4 Cornets in all, and we have loste but 70 horse
<newline/>
which I thincke will prove a favorable reporte.
<newline/>
<newline/>
I doe also understand 
<image name="thorn"/>
at the States have a purpose, if they finde
<newline/>
upon triall, that Huy is stronge and tenable, to take and fortifie
<newline/>
some place about 
<image name="thorn"/>
e midde way, between it and Breda, which will
<newline/>
adde a great assurance to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e holding of the towne, and doe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie
<newline/>
more annoyance. The bishop of 
<place id="9226" place_id="Liege">
Liege
</place>
 hath sent his
<newline/>
Ambassadols hither, to expostulat this taking of Huy, beyng a
