But I fynde it worth

it doth manifest

at there are many brabbles, and disconten-

States,

 I am certaine, will delyver me their answear, without

putting me of to a further delay. We have assured in-

gar people every where, crie openly out against their miseries,
<newline/>
shewing manifest token 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they desire to be joyned to the

rest of this union. And as farre as I can judge of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<newline/>
States inclination, if 
<image name="thorn"/>
e motion proceede from 
<image name="thorn"/>
e other
<newline/>
side to them, thereafter as it is they are fully bent to inter-

taine it, to

e best advantage of their cause. But whe-

ther it were expedient, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at we
 should stryke at this yron,
<newline/>
whyle it is hotte, and be the first 
<image name="thorn"/>

ceave 
<image name="thorn"/>
at most men are of minde,

at we should not sturre
<newline/>
in this case, but as occasions are presented from them
<newline/>
unto us. For this alleaged for it, That before they
<newline/>

e Enemie, in a mater of 
<image name="thorn"/>
at importance, they
<newline/>
<folioref id="1278">

 must first of force heere at home have recourse to every Pro-

every towne, and soe come abroade among 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people, who as
<newline/>
every man doubtes, may prove soe over headlong in suche
<newline/>
a plausible motion, as perhaps when they see it is once
<newline/>
sette a foote, they will violently thorowe, without regarde
<newline/>
to their owne securitie. The feare of this humor in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
