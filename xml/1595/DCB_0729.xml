 good L. The remises and disputes,

</super>
 one litle scruple,

then could after be recovered in many consultations
<newline/>
which continual expectation of their final reso-

This hath held us together in a long disputation,

in so muche as not agreeing on a point of suche

 I am to beseech
<newline/>
yow most humblie and earnestly to lette me knowe
<newline/>
by this bearer, (whome I send of sette purpose to winne
<newline/>

<super id="0191" replace="hnes">

</super>

<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at so fully, if yow please, as I may not be inforced to
<newline/>
replie thereunto, and so attending some further l
<overline id="0188" replace="ettre">
re
</overline>
:
<newline/>
nor they to picke a quarel to start from their offers,
<newline/>
or to denie me or delay me, by taking newe occasions
<newline/>
to repaire unto their Provinces. And to shewe yo
<super id="0185" replace="ur">
r
</super>
<newline/>
L. what I thinke, they have framed in their fancies
<newline/>
so many dangerous inconveniences, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at may falle upon
<newline/>
their State, by binding themselves to her Ma
<super id="0182" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 heires
<newline/>
as they will give no way, to any motion, that may tend
<newline/>
to suche a purpose. They enquire very often
<newline/>
of me whether her Hig
<super id="0179" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
 be privie to anie part of my
<newline/>
Ouverture, but I endevor w
<super id="0176" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 I can to keepe it from
<newline/>
their knowledge. And I am told by 
<person id="0798" person_id="Oldenbarnvelt">
M
<super id="0173" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Barnevelt
</person>
,
<newline/>
<folioref id="0170">
fol.36r
</folioref>
 and doe otherwise perceave it by divers conjectures,
<newline/>
that it is not yet imagined in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e meeting of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States
<newline/>
though it may be 
<image name="thorn"/>
at some fewe may somew
<super id="0801" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 surmise
<newline/>
it. For I have ever so caried 
<image name="thorn"/>
e course of my dealing
<newline/>
as all 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I have done or sayed in these affaires, hath
<newline/>
seemed still unto 
<image name="thorn"/>
e multitude 
<insertion id="0241">
to
</insertion>
 proceede as of myself
<newline/>
and from my privat advise, and care of their pros-
<newline/>
peritie. For so I did conceave, it would stand best
<newline/>
of all w
<super id="0323" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 her Hig
<super id="0320" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
 contentation, not to seeme to
<newline/>
understand, that they doe her any pleasure, in
<newline/>
making suche an offer, but that they should repute
<newline/>
it, for a singular grace, if their offer be accepted.
<newline/>
And in this negotation to yeeld to M

r
</super>
 Barnevelt
<newline/>
his dewe co
<overline id="0804" replace="mm">

maters so advisedly, and soundly and w

 suche

special regard to her Ma

ties
</super>
 good liking, dignitie
<newline/>
and State, for as farre as lay in him, as I can
<newline/>
no choose but signifie, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at although for my self, I had
<newline/>
never no doubt of his carefull proceeding, yet nowe
<newline/>
by proofe I founde it more then I had reason to ex-
<newline/>
pect. He hath protested nothwithstanding, and
<newline/>
I have cause to beleeve him, because I have bin very
<newline/>
inward to his painefull course of dealing, and therein
<newline/>
sundrie great hasardes of his credit w
<super id="0308" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Contrey, that
<newline/>
were it integrum unto him, a very great offer should
<newline/>
not drawe him nowe againe, to engage himself fur-
<newline/>
ther then 
<image name="thorn"/>
e rest of his fellowes. I should
<newline/>
seeme by yo
<super id="0305" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. last, that his delayes in this pour-
<newline/>
suite, have discontented her Ma
<super id="0302" replace="jestie">

</super>
, but if I may
<newline/>
have 
<image name="thorn"/>
e credit to be beleeved heerein, it was not
<newline/>
possible for him to effect it any sooner: w
<super id="0299" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I can
<newline/>
manifest in his behalf, w
<super id="0296" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 so cleere a demonstration,
<newline/>
as her Hig
<super id="0293" replace="hnes">
es
</super>
 I am certaine will conceave it very rea-
<newline/>
dilie. For

<super id="0287" replace="">

, as of their doubtes and other obstacles,
<newline/>
it is thought in this place very great expedition, to
<newline/>
beginne it and ende it in 8 or 9 weekes: in so muche
<newline/>
<folioref id="0284">
fol.36v
</folioref>
 as all men heere affirme, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they never knewe [the lyke]

 with[out]

</super>
 certaine shippes of assi-

<newline/>
ner by me proposed unto them, but they gran[ted]
<newline/>
it willinglie, albeyt they are not tyed to doe it [by the]

Treatie, but in cases when 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie shall [.]
<newline/>
a Fleete, in

e chanels betweene England and [.]
<newline/>
or England and these Contreys: wheras it is [an ex-]

<newline/>
they must beare in entertaining other newe [compa-]
<newline/>
nies, in lieu of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e English auxiliaries, will [amount]
<newline/>
for this yere, above a hundred thousand poun[des.]
<newline/>
But this opinion among others hath gone curr[ant in]
<newline/>
their College, and is still 
<image name="thorn"/>
e assertion of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e m[ost, that]
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e foresaid deboursement is not so hurtfull to [their]

<image name="thorn"/>
e very bruite of

e breache of

<newline/>

by one example how hard a passage I have [found]

held it very stoutely, for too great a resolution, to

And these were onely two Deputies of one of

impeached their proceeding for so many dayes, and

caused almost their Collegues, to come to termes of
