 good L. to be advertised, that when I came to the

 awaye,
<newline/>
beying all invited by the 
<person id="0768" person_id="Hohenlo">

, to be at his mariage, with
<newline/>
the

 proposition, for the extraordi-
<newline/>
narie contribution of this yeere, for which they have demaunded
<newline/>
eight score thousand poundes sterling: which is seventie thousand
<newline/>
more then was ever yet requyred, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e laste yeere excepted. Howe it
<newline/>
will be obtained it is very uncertaine: but yet all men are in hope,
<newline/>
that it will be raised in the ende: albeit I am tould that my coming
<newline/>
heere to soone, will rather hurt then helpe it forwarde. For I 
<newline/>
doe serve my selfe of dyvers reasons to drawe them on the paye
<newline/>
their debtes, of which some will take hold to excuse their con-
<newline/>
tributing: 
<image name="thorn"/>
at if their grant had bin past before I had come
<newline/>
hither, it had bin undoubtedly a farre fitter opportunitie.
<newline/>
Yesterday morning I had my audience of the States, of whome
<newline/>
I was heard in a full assemblie: but I had no other aunswear
<newline/>
then they are wont to deliver in all suche affaires, That they
<newline/>
will take some tyme to thinke upon it, requyring to have my
<newline/>
proposition in wryting, whereof heereinclosed I send the Copie to
<newline/>
your L: I will hasten their aunswear as much as I maye,
<newline/>
and sollicit them the whyle to give her 
<person id="0789" person_id="Elizabeth">

 content. First by
<newline/>
some good portion of mony in hande: secondly by some annuall
<newline/>
payment till all be discharged: and lastly by abating a parte
<newline/>
of her present expences. they are very muche troubled
<newline/>
with this matter, and waxe so silent upon it, as I can not
<newline/>
yet imagine what successe I shall have: but I am in good
<newline/>
hope to learne out somwhat of their purpose; and to write it
<newline/>
in my next. This day I am to deale with the Councel of
<newline/>

 is come hither from the 
<person id="0801" person_id="James VI">
Scottishe Kinge

, and hath 
<newline/>
delivered his messsage: wherof all 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I can learne, is that hee
<newline/>
seeketh to renue the ancient amities and alliances between the
<newline/>
two contries: and with all is a suitor to be assisted against his
<newline/>
rebels at home: whether the K
<super id="0079" replace="ings">
s

 desire be for money or men,
<newline/>
I shall not be able to signifie directly, till I have spoken with
<newline/>
the coronel himself, or with some of the States, which I purpose
<newline/>
with the soonest and will advertise accordingly.
<newline/>
<newline/>
The reporte 
<image name="thorn"/>
at hath gone of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Germane Ambassadors, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at should
<newline/>
come to treat of peace, is still a foote in these Contreis. It is

determined, they say,

at of 12 speciall persons deputed therunto,
<newline/>
there shall sixe repayre to

witte, twoo from

<newline/>
and other twoe from the Townes: and that certaine Heraldes
<newline/>
wearing their coates shall be sent before, to declare to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people
<newline/>
in places where they passe, the ocasion of their coming. But
<newline/>
I can not yet perceave, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they have yet resolved heere, what
<newline/>
course they will take for admitting or stopping their comming
<newline/>
though I see no inclination 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they will enter into Treatie.

come hither about 6 dayes sins, it is no further yet confirmed.

<newline/>
howe they will speede, it is doubted very much, because the contrey
<newline/>
there is populous, and full of gentlemen, which are very well pro-
<newline/>
vided of warlicke furniture. But if they chaunce to hold the place
<newline/>
considering that the D. of Bouillon is there at hand, with his
<newline/>
armie, which are said together with the States forces to be 9000
<newline/>
foote, and 1500 horse, it will proove a very speciall annoyance to
<newline/>
the Ennemies actions. It is held for certaine heere,

They are greatly grieved heere,
