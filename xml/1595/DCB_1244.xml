e State of

<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Coronel hath framed his petition, for a 1000 foote and
<newline/>
500 horse, for sixe monethes: whereof I doubt not in
<newline/>
lyke sorte, but he hath notified under hande, to some
<newline/>
principal persons, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at if 3 monethes of it be advaun-
<newline/>
ced it will satisfie 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Kinge. I might be
<newline/>
drawen to conjecture by this forme of proceeding, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
before it be longe, they will graunt his demaunde,
<newline/>
it seeming a summe of soe small account, as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e K.
<newline/>
hath greater cause to disdaine to crave it, by way
<newline/>
of an Ambassade, then they to refuse to parte with

K: till they heare how her Hig

 will brooke of his

at their

interior affections are sownde and sincere. But

otherwise if their haste be soe great to condiscend to

his request,

at they will make no kinde of

reckning of her lyking or dislyking, then there might
<newline/>
be just occasion both to speake unto them in other

because they lacke their forces, w

out

e privitie of

e
<newline/>

<image name="thorn"/>
e common people grudge 
<newline/>
at it, and at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e sending of their forces to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e D.
<newline/>
of Bouillon, esteeming it fitter to imploy them at
<newline/>
home, and not to embrace so many actions, in places
<newline/>
so remote, where they have no readie meanes to 
<newline/>
seconde their Companies, or to send any rescue.
