<newline/>
Their aunswear about 
<image name="thorn"/>
e matter of remboursement is delivered
<newline/>
unto me, but nothing sayed to 
<image name="thorn"/>
<abbreviation id="0580" replace="at">

last 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 13 of this pres
<overline id="0019" replace="en">
e
</overline>
t, I well hoped to have heard in regard
<newline/>
of a further offer of some annual satisfaction to be made unto 
<newline/>
her 
<person id="9910" person_id="Elizabeth">
M
<super id="0016" replace="ajesty">

</super>
.
</person>
 For although they were in talke how somewhat
<newline/>
might be done, yet doubting in parte how 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey woulde
<newline/>
<image name="par"/>
fourme it, and partely also how her M
<super id="0030" replace="ajesty">
ty
</super>
 would accept of
<newline/>
a little, they grewe to no c
<overline id="0033" replace="on">
o
</overline>
clusion. All their aunswear
<newline/>
in a maner, some certaine pointes excepted, is 
<image name="thorn"/>
e same 
<image name="thorn"/>
<abbreviation id="0581" replace="at">

</abbreviation>
 when I reported in like maner what
<newline/>
was replyed againe by me, and I know not w
<super id="0039" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 more can be
<newline/>
added now unto it. Againe I am 
<image name="par"/>
suaded 
<image name="thorn"/>
<abbreviation id="0582" replace="at">
t
</abbreviation>
 nothing 
<newline/>
will prevaille, whatsoever I say besides, because 
<image name="thorn"/>
e matter
<newline/>
is so fitte for replyes and rejoinders, 
<image name="thorn"/>
<abbreviation id="0583" replace="at">
t
</abbreviation>
 there would be no

ende of disputing upon it. That w
<super id="0060" replace="hich">
c

 they have alleadged
<newline/>
of their detriments receaved by meanes of fluddes and
<newline/>
water breaches, I suppose to be no lesse then they seeme
<newline/>
to insinuat. For

would signifie, what they had sayd by worde of mouth, and

 I remember

oftentimes debated this matter of my message, and were excee-

</abbreviation>
 w

vered unto me by worde of mouthe, but in very humble termes
