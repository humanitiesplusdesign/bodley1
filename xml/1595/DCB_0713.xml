more then they give commonly, at the first

was at

<newline/>
They have mett very often about

<newline/>
that I must needes have the patience to

attend a little longer: for that they had

not yet concluded, what answear they
<newline/>
might make, but found it every waye

a mater full of infinit danger, if they

should not proceede w

 of Estate, which are together at 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
to the end, with their advise, they might

I can conjecture, they are fullie bent to sa-

but I can not yet perceave in what sort
<newline/>
they are inclined, to propose 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mater to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>

<newline/>
by imparting their advise, and by persua-

ding with the people, to assent to a certaine
<newline/>
summe, ether that which I have signified,
<newline/>
or that they shall sette downe, I may hap-

pelie have an answear with some expedi-

give direction to

e Provinces (as I finde

them that way very backward) but shall
<newline/>
barely make request, to knowe their reso-

sitions, suche a generall kinde of writing
<newline/>
will occasion great varietie in returne of

their answears, which are of force to be re-
<newline/>
duced, by often sending too and fro, to a full
<newline/>
accord of all in one (because they goe not
<newline/>
in suche cases by pluralitie of voyces) and
<newline/>
then what time it will require, your L.
<newline/>
will conjecture. I will therfore endevo
<super id="0137" replace="">

<newline/>
by all meanes I can devise, to drawe them

<newline/>
they shew so litle token of hearkning unto

unto your L. to make it knowen unto her

</super>
 I see the chiefest heere among them
<newline/>
full of silence and sadnesse, for the trou-

bles and discomfortes, which they declare
<newline/>
to come by heapes upon the people of this
<newline/>

<newline/>
to discouragement and danger. They
<newline/>
alleage in dealing with me, their losses
<newline/>
in winter, by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e great inundations, wherof
<newline/>
a great contrey complaineth continually;
<newline/>
the contention of the Provinces, about their
<newline/>
contributions, which are not yet appeased;
<newline/>
the consumption of their troupes, which they
<newline/>
sent to

the soddaine want, that is noted of all

with this message of mine for restitution

of her monies: in so muche as they affirme,

that if there come not in somwhat some

amendement of their Estate, to keepe the

people from despaire (wherof they doe pro-
<newline/>
test that their hope is very slender) they
<newline/>
are very muche in doubt of some soddaine
<newline/>
alteration: which is also feared will be-
<newline/>
ginne among the mariners and sea men:
<newline/>
that as they were the chiefest in delive-

ring the Contrey from the bondage of the 
<newline/>
Enemie, so they doubt that nowe againe
