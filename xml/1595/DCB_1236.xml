Maye it please your good L. to be advertised, that when I came to

e
<newline/>
27 of

</person>
 away, beying all invited by

e 
<person id="3149" person_id="Hohenlo">
Co:
<newline/>
of Hohenlo
</person>
 to be at his mariage, with 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="3152" person_id="Buren, M">
Countesse of Bueren
</person>
, which was
<newline/>
solemnised at 
<place id="3155" place_id="Buren">
Bueren,
</place>
 a little towne with a Castell appertaining to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e

</place>
 I doe finde in like manner,

</place>
 have not yelded as yet to

</person>
 propositions, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
extraordinarie contribution of this yeere; for which they have demaunded
<newline/>
eight score thowsand poundes sterling: which 
<insertion id="0040">
is
</insertion>
 seventie thousand more
<newline/>
then was ever yet required, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e last yere excepted: Howe it will be ob-
<newline/>
tained it is very uncertaine: but yet all men are in hope that it
<newline/>
will be raised in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e ende: albeit I am tould that my co
<overline id="0037" replace="mm">
m
</overline>
ing heere so
<newline/>
soone will rather hurt then helpe it forward. For I doe serve my
<newline/>
selfe of divers reasons, to drawe them on to paye their debtes, of which
<newline/>
some will take hould to excuse their contributing; 
<image name="thorn"/>
at if their graunt
<newline/>
had bin past before I had come hither, it had bin undoubtedly a farre
<newline/>
fitter opportunitie. Yesterday morning I had my audience of 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>

<newline/>
aunswear then they are wont to deliver in all suche affaires,
<newline/>
That they will take some tyme to thincke upon it, requring to have
<newline/>

<newline/>
good portion of mony in hande, secondly by some annual paym
<super id="0062" replace="ent">

</super>
 till
<newline/>

<newline/>
pences. They are very muche trobled with this matter, and waxe
<newline/>
so silent upon it, as I can not yet imagine what successe I shall
<newline/>
have, but am in good hope, to learne out somew
<super id="3170" replace="hat">

and to write it in my nexte. This daye I am to deale with
