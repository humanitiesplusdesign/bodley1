made careles what became of his causes. For besides his owne

ill conceat and report of my doinges, his parents have inveighed
<newline/>
most bitterly against me, at their open table, and in the presence
<newline/>
of divers gentlemen of mine owne acquaintance. Upon intelligence

 I was sure must needes

possible, to persuade him to surcease, and to take some better

course. Howbeit of as many of his l

written every one in generall tearmes, That he had done nothing

out very good warrant, That the Councel of Estate did

wrong him very muche, And that I shoulde doe him a greate

 the

just occasion of great offence against him, w
<super id="1106" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 using continually
<newline/>
a superficial kinde of speeche, That they were ill informed of
<newline/>
him, and that all that he did, was for the good of the contrey 
<newline/>
<missing id="1592" type="erosion">
without coming to particulars, to satisfie those matters of which they
</missing>
<newline/>
<folioref id="1116">
fol.124v

<newline/>
complained. This made them utter oftentimes very pass
<missing id="1595" type="fire">

<newline/>
in terming all his doinges a meere deludinge and mocking

<newline/>
them and of the state: and also affirming that the lest

both of

his offenses, in a subject of this contrey, should be ca

punished. And wheras divers were desirous, to decree

 And

at imagination, I am certaine,

hath bin
</missing>
<newline/>
the chiefest occasion of their not proceeding to some hard

resolution.
</missing>
<newline/>
His case standing thus, it was not possible for me, to 
<missing id="1622" type="fire">
do him
</missing>
<newline/>
hitherto any pleasure. For matters were too evident, 
<missing id="1625" type="fire">
to speak

<newline/>
in his defense, and to crave any favo
<super id="1139" replace="">

</super>
, it was but in

vain
</missing>
<newline/>
when he woulde never acknowledge,

<newline/>
it,

at he was wrongfully charged. In effect his 
<missing id="1637" type="fire">
own ill
</missing>
<newline/>
handling of his matters, hath bin so highly displeasing 
<missing id="1640" type="fire">
to the

Councel of state, as I knowe not how they can be 
<missing id="1643" type="fire">
