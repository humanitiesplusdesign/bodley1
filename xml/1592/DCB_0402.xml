 in case they

found them selves thertoo to be sufficiently authorised. W

ch

 I did
<newline/>
for good respect, for that it had bin a question in their dealing

 before
<newline/>
whether they in that place, or those at the Hage, having both like
<newline/>
commission from the generality of 
<image name="thorn"/>

powre of

ty

<newline/>
they disclaimed that authority, and put mee over to the Hage for

delivery of my letters. Howbeit I omitted not to signifie the

<abbreviation id="1609" replace="at">

 I was able, to amplifie the

reasons, and to pray them not to hinder the execution of my

<super id="1302" replace="hnes">
nes

 promise was so past, that it could
<newline/>
not be revoked, and I had order therafter, to cause the troupes

that were desired, to put them selves in p
<overline id="1311" replace="resent">
nt
</overline>
 redines. They were
<newline/>
much amazed at

e matter, and used great intreatie, that no

separation might be made of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e English from the rest, till the

 might both weaken them in strength, and put them

farre out of order, when her Hig

<newline/>
precisely upon the pointes of my charge, and requested them
<newline/>
earnestly to graunt a patent to every companie to repaire to his
<newline/>
garrison, and that there they might remaine, untill such time as
<newline/>
they were sent for. This I urged continually, as having
<newline/>
no kinde of liberty, to dispose in other sorte of her Ma

continueth there in place, and hath resolved not to alter, but to

e meane time
<newline/>
because they did refuse to determin theruppon, referring mee
<newline/>
hither to this assembly of

 time within a mile of

Swoll,
</highlight>
 from whence I thinke they will not stirre, till they heare
<newline/>
what is said by the States of this place. Yesterday morning
<newline/>
I presented my letters in their publick meeting, w
<super id="1397" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 when I had
<newline/>
heard, bring openly read (for I had no coppie sent unto mee)
<newline/>
I noted a certaine clause, w
<super id="1402" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
, I am very much afraide, wil put
<newline/>
mee to some trouble. For it goeth w
<super id="1406" replace="ith">
th
</super>
 condition that if
<newline/>
the armie of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e States may bee commodiously dissolved, and the

that then the

french King
</person>
 shall have 
<image name="thorn"/>
e use of those succors that are
<newline/>
promised unto him. But, as if I had not understood it
<newline/>
I urged very earnestly 
<image name="thorn"/>
e King
<image name="es"/>
 necessity, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e importance of
<newline/>
the matter in respect of these contreys, and proposed all 
<image name="thorn"/>
e point
<image name="es"/>
<newline/>
of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e instructions sent unto mee, w
<super id="1436" replace="ith">
th
</super>
out leaving to their choice, to
<newline/>
denie her Hig
<super id="1433" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 her demaund. They saied but litel as then to
<newline/>
any parte of my speech, but as their custome is commonly in
<newline/>
causes of consequence, they required some time to signifie their
<newline/>
answere. They had notice of the matter before my coming to
<newline/>
the 
<highlight id="1442" Type="italic">
Hage,
</highlight>
 and receaved out of 
<place id="0733" place_id="England">

</place>
 a coppie of

between her Hig

they do highlie dislike to have bin donne w

th

 them alredy. But
<newline/>
if they seeme in that respect to complaine in publick place, I
<newline/>
have matter enough for answere. I ame onely now to seeke
<newline/>
w

 waie I shalbee able to reconcile the forsesaid clause, w

th

 that
<newline/>
w
<super id="0701" replace="hich">

 I proposed, for as I learne under hand by a frinde among

<newline/>
and will seeme to take no knowledge, that her Ma
