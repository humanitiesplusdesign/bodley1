judice, and make it an argument, to prove her

the worst of this scruple, I have declared heere

unto them, but all

 ende there might be some order
<newline/>
for their further renforcing, and for keeping them

heereafter in some better condition. For mine

<newline/>
I had no kinde of meanes to give yo

 uncertaintie. And to take information

from

e Englishe Commissaries, I thought an im-
<newline/>
perfect and deceatfull meanes, for 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it was
<newline/>
apparant that by them, and their voluntary
<newline/>
sufferance, or notorious negligence, those disor-
<newline/>
ders were growen. Wherupon I made re-
<newline/>
quest 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they would condescend, to send their
<newline/>
owne Commissaries to every suche place, where
<newline/>
the Englishe souldiers are in Garrison, and all
<newline/>
at one time, and upon

Englishe Officers, as they should rather be as-

sisted then impeached, in

<newline/>
upon it, to take a transcript of their Rolles, I
<newline/>
would send them presently home, to be compa-
<newline/>
red w
<super id="0203" replace="ith">
