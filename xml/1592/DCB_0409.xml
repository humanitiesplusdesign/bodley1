 as the rest of their creditors: w

t
</super>
 this letter, as I have also

sent a copie to

e Coronel himself. But all their
<newline/>
answear in 
<image name="thorn"/>
at behalf is no better in effect then a

cunning denial. For if they were inclined to any

equitie in his suite, they knowe his case doth differ
<newline/>
muche, from 
<image name="thorn"/>
e most of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e rest, to whome 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey
<newline/>
is indebted. For when they made their composition,
<newline/>
he was actual gouverno
<super id="0167" replace="">

</super>
 of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e towne of Meden-
<newline/>
blike, and they contracted plainely w
<super id="0161" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 him,

at ether
<newline/>
he should continue as gouverno

 in

<insertion id="0158">
honorable
</insertion>
<newline/>
discharge, and contentment w
<super id="0171" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 reason for all his ser-
<newline/>
vices forepast. Wherupon I have insisted, that al-
<newline/>
though they doe pretend 
<image name="thorn"/>
e want of meanes and abi-
<newline/>
litie to pay 
<image name="thorn"/>
e summes 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he demaundes, yet it is a
<newline/>
mater in their power, and a part of their couven
<overline id="0181" replace="an">
a
</overline>
t,
<newline/>
to restoare him to his gouvernment. The replie
<newline/>
that they make is but a dallieng abuse, by perver-
<newline/>
ting 
<image name="thorn"/>
e sense of a plaine composition. For they say
<newline/>
they are but bounde, to content him w
<super id="0189" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 reason: and
<newline/>
they thinke he ought to take it for a reasonable con-
<newline/>
tentment, in 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they promise to intreat him, as the
<newline/>
rest of their creditors. W
<super id="0196" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 in effect is no better, but
<newline/>
presently to leese 
<image name="thorn"/>
e benefit of his gouvernment, and
<newline/>
to have as muche as nothing, for his recompense heere-
<newline/>
after: and so I have not failed to lette them under-
<newline/>
tand. But to impart to yo
<super id="0204" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. my privat
<newline/>
conceat, though they themselves will not signifie 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
 mysterie of their meaning in this twart kinde of 
<newline/>
d
ealing, yet they make it very manifest by the
<newline/>
course of their doinges, and by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e cleerenes of their
<newline/>
<folioref id="0214">
fol.166r
</folioref>
 speeches in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e causes of some others. For thus they
<newline/>
are persuaded, and nothing can be said, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at will 
<newline/>
dissuade them from it, That when my 
<person id="0600" person_id="Dudley, R">
L. of Lei-
<newline/>
cester
</person>
 was chosen to this gouvernment, he had a
<newline/>

e princi-
<newline/>
pall plotters of those intended alterations, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at were
<newline/>
essaied in divers townes. And this opinion of
<newline/>
their disloialtie is rooted so deepely in a nomber
<newline/>
of this nation, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at though they
