former agreement we coulde wishe diverse thinges

were reformed, but being out of hope thereof,
<newline/>
and forced with the tyme to yeild to some
<newline/>
Inconvenience, we desire onely, that the terme

<newline/>
in certificate (w

 we take to be to longe and

unreasonable) may for the reasons by us set

downe be reduced to a more reasonable and

shorter tyme, as to six monthes, yf yt be possible:
<newline/>
for those twoe pointes w

ch

 were referred and yet
<newline/>
are in the states determination, we require for

the first, that all tare may be made in one

Towne, and for the second that we may have
<newline/>
our advise and consent in the choosinge and
<newline/>
placing of the Tare maisters./ These twoe
