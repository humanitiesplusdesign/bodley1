 had resolved to do somewhat in

<newline/>
not imparted as yet to

e 
<person id="4984" person_id="Council of State">

to advertise her

 For though they purpose of themselves

to send a messenger unto her, yet their meaning is first to sounde

nes

 good liking, by some motion in general, to induce the

<newline/>
of their dessigne was delivered thus unto mee, That forasmuche

as

the Englishe nation, as of

e people of thes Provinces, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state
<newline/>
of bothe contreys into infinite perils: in that respect they thought

it needfull, that they should be mightely assailed, both by

<newline/>
For good perfourmance wherof, they wil be willing for their

abilitie, to extend it to

<newline/>
their part

 10 or 12 good ships, and every ship of 200 tonnes

w

<folioref id="0106">
fol.255v

 and they think that the Provinces will bee moved to do nothing.
<newline/>
For the place, w

<newline/>
suffered to settell there at will, they can want no opportunity
<newline/>
to stop

e course of all traffique; and still have meanes
<newline/>
to bee relieved. For they saie that 
<place id="4996" place_id="Dunkirk">

 is sufficient
<newline/>
to send some 30 ships to sea. For the time of this service
<newline/>
they have assigned it in Julj, having no comodious meanes to

undertake it any sooner. And for the raising of those troupes
