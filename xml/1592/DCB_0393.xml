to move him to advance it, he made me this

at belon

he thought it very hard, to be pressed therunto,

 wherunto I replied,

<newline/>
all apparance, he was already reduced to suche
<newline/>
termes of extremitie, as an opportunitie nowe
<newline/>
served, to precipitat all his power, and that
<newline/>
very shortly, by assisting

to that w

 For if they would resolve, to concurre in some
