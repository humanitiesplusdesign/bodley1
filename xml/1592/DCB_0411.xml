<newline/>
whome first it had bin fitte I should have

earnestly urged, to take some present resolu-

 writte

unto

<newline/>
then 
<image name="thorn"/>
e letter gave occasion. I beseeche
<newline/>
yo
<super id="0461" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. for the first, to give me so muche cre-
<newline/>
dit, that I did my duty thorowly, in requi-
<newline/>
ring their answear: as I doe alwaies 
<image name="thorn"/>
e like,
<newline/>
in affaires of any moment, though I happen
<newline/>
to omitte to signifie suche pointes. For I pre-
<newline/>
sented her Hig
<super id="0475" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 letter 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 14 of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e forsaid mo-
<newline/>
neth, and I sent yo
<super id="0478" replace="">
w
</super>
 their answear w
<super id="0472" replace="ith">
t
</super>
in two
<newline/>
daies after: w
<super id="0483" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I doe seeldome gette so soone,
<newline/>
but w
<super id="0487" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 great importunitie. For they say they
<newline/>
are a multitude, and in maters of importance
<newline/>
they can not so resolve, as her Ma
<super id="0491" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 may alone.
<newline/>
And as for writing before, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I receaved their
<newline/>
answear, when I could not have it presently,
<newline/>
<folioref id="0499">
fol.175v
</folioref>
 nor no certaintie otherwise, when they would
<newline/>
exhibit it, I thought I should doe best for con-
<newline/>
tenting yo
<super id="0510" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. to advertise w
<super id="0507" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e soonest howe
<newline/>
I had proceeded, and w
<super id="0513" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 I thought of their pur-
<newline/>
pose, and yet still to goe forward in soliciting
<newline/>
their answear, w
<super id="0525" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I sent 
<image name="thorn"/>
e next day after.
<newline/>
<newline/>
I hope yo
<super id="0522" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. is persuaded, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at for
<newline/>
mine owne understanding I was not troubled
<newline/>
w
<super id="0530" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 any scruple in her Ma
<super id="0533" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 letter. For I knewe
<newline/>
directly what was meant, by those 
<image name="thorn"/>
at I receaved,
<newline/>
and so I signified sufficiently in my publike dea-
<newline/>
ling w
<super id="0546" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states. But being heere where I sawe
<newline/>
howe muche it went against their mindes, and
<newline/>
finding 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e letter was not altogether peremptory,
<newline/>
but indited in suche wordes, as seemed in the rea-
<newline/>
ding to include a kinde of libertie, I hope yo
<super id="0551" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L.
<newline/>
will conceave 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e maner of my suspition, in 
<newline/>
respect of their construction, was not founded
<newline/>
upon nothing. True it is 
<image name="thorn"/>
at her Ma
<super id="0561" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 writte
<newline/>
enough, both 
<insertion id="0564">
at
</insertion>
 that time and before, whereby they
<newline/>
might perceave, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at her meaning was no other,
<newline/>
but to send for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e companies: yet it was not in
<newline/>
the letter in 
<image name="thorn"/>
at resolut maner, as if she would
<newline/>
not be refused, or as her Hig
<super id="0586" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 heeretofore in
<newline/>
suche other her demaundes hath signified ex-
<newline/>
pressely. And although it was sufficient
<newline/>
that I declared it unto them, because they
<newline/>
were referred to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e pointes of my instructions,
<newline/>
yet knowing they were inclined to stand upon
<newline/>
denial, I could not but imagine, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they would
<newline/>
helpe them selves in every sort, w
<super id="0583" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 any wordes of
<newline/>
<folioref id="0590">
fol.176r
</folioref>
 apparance of advantage unto them. And so it
<newline/>
proved by their answear. I did
<newline/>
yesterday deliver her Ma
<super id="0598" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 letter, w
<super id="0601" replace="hich">
ch

 they thought
<newline/>
very strange to come so slowly to their handes,

 the
<newline/>

a great deale of time, and devise howe to crosse

ei

will make, I can not learne, nor conjecture.
<newline/>
For although I have bin instant in requiring it
<newline/>
of them, they say they must have time to delibe-
