 Sir, I was in good hope, to have seene
<newline/>
your answere to my letter of the 15
<super id="0438" replace="">
th
</super>
 of December. You
<newline/>
knowe in yo
<super id="0442" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 owne discretion, I had reason to expect it:
<newline/>
and I thought that in curtesie, you would somwhat content
<newline/>
mee. But seing it is otherwise, I trust you do
<newline/>
consider, that your silence cannot answere the cause of
<newline/>
my complaint. I have moved this 
<person id="2437" person_id="Council of State">
Councel
</person>
 to that
<newline/>
effect, as you request, that some order may bee taken, for the
<newline/>
monethlie paiement of your entertainment, and for the arre-
<newline/>
rages; but their answere and yo
<super id="0452" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 demand, are far disagreeing.
<newline/>
For wheras you doe require after 3

 a daie, their
<newline/>
allowance, they saie, is but 40

</super>
 a moneth, as is expreslie
<newline/>
set downe in yo

 commission. Besides they do insist,
<newline/>
that the somme, that is dew for yo
<super id="0471" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 entertainment, is a 
<newline/>
very small parcel of that, w
<super id="0478" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 is dew by you to the Contrey.
<newline/>
This is all the answere, that I can get at their handes:
<newline/>
and I looke for none other to all yo
<super id="0484" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 demandes, til some
<newline/>
real satisfaction be made unto them. For, to tel you
<newline/>
somwhat neerer how they are affected, They do repute
<newline/>
them selves to bee apparantly deluded in all the letters that
<newline/>
you send, and that you thinke by devises to go beyond
<newline/>
them, w
<super id="0492" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
, they saie, they will reforme, and I do signify
<newline/>
thus plainely, to the end you may consyder both what opinion
<newline/>
they conceave of yo
<super id="2431" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 dealing, and what meanes you are to use,
<newline/>
to come in better favour.

And so I leave you, and commend
<newline/>
you to Gods preservation. From the Hage the 12
