 For all their marchants in a maner, not onely in

the townes

if it came in any question between her Hig

 and
<newline/>
them, it would be many waies declared, and prov[ed]

effectually,

as it could not be answeared w

in his speeches unto them, when they gave him his

be contended to accept of

to thinke,

at it would not be denied. To this

they told him againe,

at first for

<image name="thorn"/>
e causes of

e marchants, they did not seeme to dislike of t[hat]
<newline/>
proceeding by way of commission: but yet they
<newline/>
would not of themselves become suitors to have [it.]

Because they thought by

because it will turne M

had very litle hope,

boaren unto him by

any good liking

they judge him to be partiall, and too muche ad-
