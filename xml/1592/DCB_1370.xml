 late proceedinges in the Tare matter

with Intercourse, auncient privileges, and custome, do thinke
<newline/>
the same wholy overhard and prejudiciall, and therefore notwith-
<newline/>
standing the provisionall agreement in Maye laste, hope that we
<newline/>
yett may be heard for the whole:/ But we considering what
<newline/>
hathe heretofore passed in this busines, how that of force we
<newline/>
muste yeild to some inconvenience in these tymes, and being wholye
<newline/>
unwilling to enter into any new suite or trouble, take yt to be
<newline/>
our best course for this tyme to expect the resolutione of
<newline/>
the states upon those twoe pointes which as yet hang undiscided
<newline/>
and to shew our grieves conceived of that which they have

alredy determined, using herein suche good meanes and reasons,

the said article of Treatye, as also of other articles of

Intercourse, and privilege pertinent to our causes: that
<newline/>
thereby yt may appear unto you, what hathe been in use
<newline/>
heretofore, and what yt is we desire at this instant:
<newline/>
namely: that the Tare may be made in one Towne, that
<newline/>
no Tare maisters be appointed without our advice, and consent,
<newline/>
And that the tyme for delivery of Certificates of Tare (which
<newline/>
the States have adjourned to Eleven monthes) may be, yf
<newline/>
not accordinge to the olde order expressed in all our
<newline/>
privileges, Four monthes, yet at the
 most six monthes:
<newline/>
which our demaundes we thinke to agree with all equitye
<newline/>
and reasone, and they ought to condiscend unto in our
<newline/>
Judgementes: besides we doubt not, but they will remember,
<newline/>
what they have heretofore graunted us in their open lett

without innovatione or concludinge anye thing against us
<newline/>
contrarye thereunto without our good lykinges: And this is the

best matter we can allegde for our selves, yf anye thing
