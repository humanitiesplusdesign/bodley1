<newline/>
if my former letter, of

prevent it, by sending an other copie.

<newline/>
The 20 Enseignes of footmen, w

<newline/>
growen so feeble and full of infirmitie, by
<newline/>
meanes of their long continuance in

<newline/>
whereto they have bin forced for want of a

<image name="thorn"/>
e winde draweth Esterly.
<newline/>
<newline/>
The time of their returne is limited to the
<newline/>
15 day of Marche, after their account: but if
<newline/>
neede require, I thinke they shall be spared
<newline/>
for one moneth longer. The
