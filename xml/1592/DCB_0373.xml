formerly written, to make him some answear

to

 L. a truth,

for mine owne particular I did flatly oppose,
<newline/>
and so did others of this Councel, against the

geving of a Pasport, to licence his comming so
<newline/>
farre as 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Hage. For albeit he professeth re-
<newline/>
ligion, and is a frinde, as they say, to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e cause
<newline/>
of these contreis, yet I though it was not
<newline/>
otherwise to be scanned, but 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he would al-
<newline/>
waies be faithfull to his master
