 the

copies are reserved, of as many as have bin written
<newline/>
of one side or other, sins 
<image name="thorn"/>
e time of his admission, he
<newline/>
gave them alwaies just occasion of great offense
<newline/>
against him, w
<super id="1546" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 using continually a superficial
<newline/>
forme of speeche, That they were ill informed of him,
<newline/>
and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at all 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he did, was for 
<image name="thorn"/>
e good of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey,
<newline/>
w

t
</super>
out comming to particulars, to satisfie those
<newline/>
maters of w
<super id="1561" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 they complained. This made them
<newline/>
utter often times very passionat speeches, in ter-
<newline/>
ming all his doinges a mere deluding and moc-
<newline/>
king both of them and of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state: and also affir
<newline/>
ming 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e lest of many of his offenses, in a sub-
<newline/>
ject of this contrey, should be capitally punished.
<newline/>
And wheras divers were desirous, to decree
<newline/>
against him w
<super id="1573" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 some rigo
<super id="1576" replace="">
r
</super>
, it was doubted by
<newline/>
some others, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at it might be a meanes to make him mu-

tine, and to doe as

</place>
 
<newline/>
And 
<image name="thorn"/>
at imagination, I am certaine, hath bin 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
chiefest occasion of their not proceeding to some
<newline/>
hard resolution. His case standing thus,
<newline/>
it was not possible for me, to doe him hitherto
<newline/>
any pleasure. For maters were too evident, to
<newline/>
speake in his defense, and to crave any favo
<super id="1593" replace="">
r
</super>
, it
<newline/>
was but in vaine: when he would never acknow-
<newline/>
lege, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he had injured 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey, and submitte
<newline/>
himselfe unto them, but alwaies stand upon it, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
he was wrongfully charged. In effect his
<newline/>
<folioref id="1602">
fol.185r
</folioref>
 owne ill handling of his maters, hath bin so
<newline/>
highly displeasing to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Councel of state, as I knowe
<newline/>
not howe 
<image name="thorn"/>
ei can be ended, but to his or their dis-
<newline/>
credit. But for my self, I protest unto yo
<super id="1610" replace="ur">

 of advancing

<newline/>
if there be any meanes to pacifie these maters, there
<newline/>
shall nothing be omitted,

at I am able to devise.
<newline/>
<newline/>
As I receaved in charge from my LL. of
