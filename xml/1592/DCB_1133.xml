advertise her

 For though they purpose of themselves to send

a messenger unto her, yet their meaninge is first, to sounde her
<newline/>
Highnes good likinge, by some motion in general, to induce the
<newline/>
Provinces therby, to allowe the sooner of their doing. The effect
<newline/>
of their designe was delivered thus unto me, That for asmuche
<newline/>
as the Spaniard hath taken a strong footing in divers places of

Britaine, w

<newline/>
of the Englishe nation, as of the people of these Provinces,
<newline/>
and the state of both contreis into infinite perils, in that respect
<newline/>
they thought it needfull, that they should be mightily assailed
<newline/>
both by land and by sea, and all uppon the soddaine, w

<newline/>
them the leasure to multiplie further, or to fortifie their places.
<newline/>
For good perfourmance wherof they will be willing for their abilitie
<newline/>
to extend it to the uttermost. They will arme for their partes
<newline/>
10 or 12 good shippes, and every shippe of 200 tonnes, w

They will also take order for defraieng the charges of 2000 soul-
