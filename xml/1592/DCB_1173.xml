ceat, though
<newline/>
they themselves will not signifie

e misterie of their meaning in this

twart kinde of dealing, yet they make it very manifest by

e course
<newline/>
of their doinges, and by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e cleerenes of their speeches in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e causes of

some others. For thus they are

suaded, and nothing can be said, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
will dissuade them from it, That when my

<newline/>
chosen to this governm

second his dessignes, but were 
<image name="thorn"/>
e principal plotters of those intended

at were essayed in divers townes. And this opinion of
<newline/>
their disloyaltie is rooted so deeply in a number of this nation,

at
<newline/>
though they seeme in open shewe, not to seeke to revenge it, they will
