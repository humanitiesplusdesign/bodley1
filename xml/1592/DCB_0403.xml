, I procured an assemblie
<newline/>
not onely of

</super>
<newline/>
letters to

<newline/>
thereto to be sufficiently autorised. Whiche I did
<newline/>
for good respect, for

at it had bin a question in

their dealinges before, whether they in

 they disclamed

at autoritie,
<newline/>
and putte me over to

<image name="thorn"/>
at I was able to
<newline/>
amplifie 
<image name="thorn"/>
e reasons, and to pray them not to
<newline/>
hinder

<super id="0066" replace="hnes">

<newline/>

at it could not be revoked,
<newline/>
and I had order thereafter, to cause 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
that were desired, to putte themselves in present

the mater, and used great intreatie,

them in strength, and putte them farre out of

precisely upon

at there they
<newline/>
might remaine, untill suche time as they were sent
<newline/>
for. This I urged continually, as having no kinde

of libertie, to dispose in other sort of her Ma

unto them: who continueth there in place, and hath

resolved not to alter but to prosecut

e mater, as I
<newline/>
have begonne it. In 
<image name="thorn"/>
e meane time, because they
<newline/>
did refuse to determine there upon it, referring
<newline/>
me hither to this assemblie of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states, I departed
<newline/>
from thens 
<image name="thorn"/>
e next day folowing, and came hither to

presented my letters in their publike meeting, whiche
<newline/>
when I had heard, being openly read, (for I had no

<newline/>

<newline/>
They saide but litle as then to any part of my speeche,
<newline/>
but as their custome is commonly in causes of conse-
<newline/>

<newline/>
answear. They had notice of 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
my comming to
