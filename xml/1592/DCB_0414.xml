praied them to thinke,

at there was not any meanes,

to differ

by

at this present to be put in execution. And so I

desired

their further assurance of her full determination,

I offered them to reade

<newline/>
They would not seeme to put in doubt

e truth of

my speeche, and therfor sought not to see w

went presently aside, and after communication

 considering howe muche it importeth her self,
<newline/>
they were sure she would be moved, to have her peo-

<image name="thorn"/>
e castel

and was encamped close unto it. If

for

ring of their forces, runne in danger of

<newline/>
both of them and all

<newline/>
discredit

occasion of murmur to

e commons of

who had yelded this sommer to a great deale greater

contribution, for an extraordinarie levie, then
<newline/>
they had ever done before, amounting at

e lest 
<newline/>
to six score thousand poundes sterling: w

 would

at their army all together, sur-

mounting every way

might make a good retrait, it was

at w

 they

doubted most. For

e Enemies commanders were

muche to be respected, as men more sufficient,
<newline/>
and of greater experience, then 
<person id="2090" person_id="Maurice">
Count Maurice
</person>
<newline/>
had any. For defense of a sconce, or of a towne,
<newline/>
and for besieging of a place, and maintening a
<newline/>
skirmishe, they were well persuaded of their
<newline/>
service: but they thought

<newline/>
<folioref id="1124">
fol.216r
</folioref>
  to bidde them battel upon

by Count Maurice,

at if any in-

 aswell for her promise, as for

<newline/>
What her Ma

 would resolve, if she knowe their pre-

<newline/>
it was not left unto me, to doe as I would, and

therfore praied their assistance to

 Francis Vere was

out their prejudice.

For if any suche mater were apparant unto him,
