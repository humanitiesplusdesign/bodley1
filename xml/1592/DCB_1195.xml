e pay of

e Contrey,

ei
<newline/>
used a kinde of cunning, in counterfaiting of
<newline/>
Dutche names, and could be hardly discovered by
<newline/>
their Commissaries in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Musters. And besides by
<newline/>
Placcartes already published, it was forbidden to
<newline/>
any Dutche Captaine, to intertene any stranger,
<newline/>
of w
<super id="1215" replace="hat">
at

 nation soever. Upon these kin[des]
<newline/>
of answears, I can not yet resolve, in w
<super id="1219" replace="hat">
at
</super>
 sort
<newline/>
I should proceede, to drawe away 
<image name="thorn"/>
e horsband.
<newline/>
I doubt very muche it will not prevaile, to
<newline/>
stoppe their weekely lendinges. Of force they must
<newline/>
have meanes, for themselves and their horses. And
<newline/>
if they live upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e towne, where they lie nowe
<newline/>
in garrison, no doubt their horses will be staied
<newline/>
till restitution shall be made. Againe if the

e Dutche souldier in

very best way,
