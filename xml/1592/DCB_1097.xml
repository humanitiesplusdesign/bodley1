<newline/>
should be over tedious, to recite every pointe

<newline/>
between us. But yet as muche as is materiall I thought fitt
<newline/>
to advertise w

 the first oportunitie. All his speeches tended

to feele w

 I would say to his proposall of a peace: and by me
<newline/>
to understand, howe her

 inclination it was
<newline/>
unknowen unto me, and likewise of

 the qualitie of those

privat

<newline/>
privat person, and by way of communication, tell him frankely
<newline/>
my opinion. Upon this he protested, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at as alwaies he professed,
<newline/>
and his father before him, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e reformed religion, so he could not but
<newline/>
tender the cause of these contreys: and in 
<image name="thorn"/>
at respect would rather
<newline/>
suffer any miserye, then become an instrument of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e spaniard, whome
<newline/>
he hated from his heart, to ruine their estate. For whiche his
<newline/>
purpose was no other, but to deale as I requested very roundly

seing there was no hope, to reconcile this people to the 
<person id="0918" person_id="Philip II">
[King of]
<newline/>
Spaine
</person>
, whome by way abjuration they had exclu[ded for]

to unite themselves in one w

 the rest of

<newline/>
desire. He delivered this but as a plotte, not acco[rded as]
<newline/>
yet by the K. of Spaine but projected by great p[ersonages]
<newline/>
who, if the Treaty be accepted, make it easie enou[gh to]
<newline/>
compasse: ether by procuring a mariage between 
<image name="thorn"/>
e [Emperor]

<image name="thorn"/>

<image name="thorn"/>
e inheritaunce of th[ese Countries]
<newline/>
to be given in dowerie; or by some other suche persu[asion, as he]
<newline/>
was well assured, would take good effect. So that [if the right]
<newline/>
of

</place>
 were derived to

<newline/>
admitted w
<super id="0692" replace="ith">
t
</super>
all, as the states might indent for their [further]
<newline/>
securitie, there was no occasion to his understandin[g why that]
<newline/>
ether 
<image name="thorn"/>
e people of these Provinces, or any of their [allies,]
<newline/>
should stand in any doubt of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e puissance of the Sp[aniard]
<newline/>
As touching the premises I made him this answear. [That]
<newline/>
first for his owne suite, I sawe no likelihood of leave [for the]
<newline/>
rest of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Commissioners to come unto 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Hage, or to [any place]
<newline/>
upon 
<image name="thorn"/>
e confines. They were many in nomber, and som[e of them]
<newline/>
they knewe by former experience, to be very ill affe[cted to the]
<newline/>
cause of these contreis, and not any but himself well [instructed]
<newline/>
in religion. By reason wherof we should alwaies [be in fear]
<newline/>
of their couvert proceeding, and corrupting of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e peop[le more]
<newline/>
over there were many respectes, for w
<super id="0715" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 I thought they [would]
<newline/>
refuse, to send any man to Collen. For 
<image name="thorn"/>
e bruite [alone of]
<newline/>
their sending, might cause an alteration, among 
<image name="thorn"/>
e co[mmons of]
<newline/>
this Contrey: and might turne to their prejudice both [in 
<place id="0927" place_id="England">
England
</place>
]
<newline/>
<folioref id="0724">
fol.15r
</folioref>
 and in 
<place id="0930" place_id="France">
Fraunce:
</place>
 where 
<image name="thorn"/>
e occasion of their sending would be knowen
<newline/>
to a fewe, but most men would imagine, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they had yelded already
<newline/>
to an actual Treaty w
<super id="0733" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie. And if their errand were
<newline/>
no other but to worke this people to a Treaty, it might aswell
<newline/>
be perfourmed by one as by many, and assoone by their letters,
<newline/>
as by their presence. For they should not neede to doubt, but
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at this Contrey would be foreward, if her Ma
<super id="0740" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 w
<super id="0743" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 whome they
<newline/>
had contracted, and the 
<person id="0933" person_id="Navarre">
F
<abbreviation id="0747" replace="rench">
r
</abbreviation>
 Kinge
</person>
 who was greatly interessed
<newline/>
would assent therunto. And for my self I was persuaded,
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at if the Empero
<super id="0753" replace="">
r
</super>
 would endevo
<super id="0756" replace="">
r
</super>
 by vertu of his Imperiall
<newline/>
autoritie among Christian Princes, to cause the 
<person id="0936" person_id="Clement">
Pope
</person>
 and
<newline/>
Kinge of Spaine, to w
<super id="0761" replace="ith">
t
</super>
drawe their forces out of France, both
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e Queene and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Kinge would presently and willingly hearken
<newline/>
to any Treaty, that might stand w
<super id="0768" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 their safetie. And untill
<newline/>
suche time, as 
<image name="thorn"/>
at be done, it was in vaine to my thinking, to
<newline/>
make any motion to them or to this people. As touching 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
Project of reducing these Provinces to the Empero
<super id="0776" replace="">
rs
</super>
 obedience,
<newline/>
being done in that order, as he had declared, by resignation of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Kinge, and suche couvenants accorded, as were meete to be requi-
<newline/>
red, as farre as I could conceave in a matter of 
<image name="thorn"/>
at moment, and
<newline/>
so newly proposed, it would not be rejected. But yet I thought
<newline/>
it would prove a tedious peece of worke. For to send first
<newline/>
into England and France to persuade their Ma
<super id="0787" replace="jesties">
ties
</super>
 to embrace a
<newline/>
Pacification: and then to use intercession w
<super id="0794" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 the Pope and w
<super id="0791" replace="ith">
t
</super>
<newline/>
Spaine, to revoke their forces: and after to capitulat upon
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e pointes of makinge over the inheritaunce of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey, it
<newline/>
would require suche lenght of time, as I see litle cause to
<newline/>
expect a good issue. Againe considering howe 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Kinge
<newline/>
shalbe touched in honor in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e ende of so many yeares warres, and
<newline/>
after the consumption of so great a treasure, to be forced by a 
<newline/>
handfull of people and by his owne Vassalls, to surrender his title
<newline/>
in so many Provinces, it is to be presumed, that he will use as
<newline/>
many shiftes to protract the time, as every light occasion shall
<newline/>
<folioref id="0811">

, who he knewe [was]

desirous to have made his motion there at first, b[ut that]

no intercession was used unto him, and of him self he [had no]
