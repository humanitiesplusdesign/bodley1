<newline/>
florins extraordinarie, to be imploied in

e next sommers warre, there
<newline/>
are letters newly written from the Councel of Estate, to everye
<newline/>
Province a part, to hasten 
<image name="thorn"/>
e sending of their deputies hither. So
<newline/>
as nowe it is supposed,

at they will be heere to assemble w

t
</super>
in
<newline/>
this fortnight at

e furthest. By this course of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Ambassado
<super id="0063" replace="">
r
</super>
,
<newline/>
the Councel of Estate is somewhat overtaken. For wheras they
<newline/>
had presumed, that he woulde not attend the comming of the states,
<newline/>
but addresse himself to them, wherby they thought, to 
<image name="thorn"/>
at effect, as I
<newline/>
have formerly written, to make him some answear to the contreis
<newline/>
advantage, their hope in 
<image name="thorn"/>
at regard is altogether frustrat. He hath
<newline/>
taken suche advise, as he will deale w
<super id="0075" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 noe others, but the states of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
Contrey. Nevertheles by all that I can conjecture, there is no suspi
<newline/>
tion to be had, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states will be wrought to admitte any Treaty.
<newline/>
To tell yo
<super id="0083" replace="ur">
r
</super>
 L. a truth, for mine owne particular I did flately oppose
<newline/>
and so did others of this Councel against the giving of a pasport, to
<newline/>
licence his comming so farre as the Hage. For albeit he professeth
<newline/>
religion, and is a frinde as they say to the cause of these contreis, yet
<newline/>
I thought it was not otherwise to be scann
<insertion id="0090">
e
</insertion>
d, but that he would alwaies
<newline/>
be faithfull to his Master the 
<person id="0382" person_id="Rudolf II">
Empero
<super id="0094" replace="">
r
</super>
,
</person>
 and that he might not happi
<newline/>
ly be acquainted w
<super id="0101" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 the Enemies mysteries, and w
<super id="0098" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 the mischiefe intended
<newline/>
to the ruine of this state. Wherupon they were to thinke, that before
<newline/>
he would depart w
<super id="0108" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out an absolut answear to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e matter of his message
<newline/>
he would not onely sojorne heere, till 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states were assembled, but
<newline/>
would deale by his ministers and letters w
<super id="0113" replace="ith">

at

<newline/>
and secret practises might produce among a ticklishe peop[le that]

muche to be considered. For I thinke yo

<newline/>
see it heere before mine eies, that howsoever the opinion i[s commonly]
