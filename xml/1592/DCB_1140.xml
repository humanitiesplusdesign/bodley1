<newline/>
might take of her owne subjectes in these countr[ies]
<newline/>
and imploye them in

ou[t]
<newline/>
asking 
<image name="thorn"/>
e consent of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e rest of

<newline/>
when 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Englishe are away, they might happ[ely]
<newline/>
be wonne, to spare as many of their owne: [.]
<newline/>
that I thought they would doe litle, w

t
</super>
out t[he]
<newline/>
assistance of o
<super id="0059" replace="ur">

 nation. To this he
<newline/>
answeared, That by way of discourse, not [.]
<newline/>
passing a moneth before, he had used speech[e to]
<newline/>
<person id="1323" person_id="Maurice">
Count Maurice
</person>
, to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e very like effect. An[d]
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count made him answear, That he w[as]
<newline/>
wholy of opinion, if her Ma
<super id="0079" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
 would be [.]
<newline/>
for her owne people onely, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states [.]
<newline/>
not use any great contradiction. But [.]
<newline/>
thinke therupon, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at when 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Englishe w[.]
<newline/>
parted, they would doe nothing of the[.]
<newline/>
to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e annoiance of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Enemie, it was [but]
<newline/>
an abuse. For said he, I remember [.]
<newline/>
upon an other like occasion, I told M[.]
<newline/>
in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e open Councel, That although 
<image name="thorn"/>
e E[nglishe]
<newline/>
forces were drawen away from hens, [.]
<newline/>
<foreign id="0094" Translation="" Language="French">
Messieurs les Estats ne laisseront s[.]

</foreign>
 This was 
<image name="thorn"/>
e [.]
<newline/>
of M
<super id="0097" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Buzenval unto me. Whereunto [.]
<newline/>
<folioref id="0101">
fol.201v
</folioref>
 That undoubtedly 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count was greatly mis-
<newline/>
taken. For I never heard him utter any
<newline/>
suche kinde of speeche, nether privatly nor pub
<newline/>
lickly: and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he might be well assured, if
<newline/>
any suche mater had bin spoken in my presence
<newline/>
he should not have caried it so cleanely away
<newline/>
I must have pressed him to knowe, whether 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
whiche he delivered were his privat opinion, or 
<image name="thorn"/>
e
<newline/>
general conceat of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e states of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e contrey. For
<newline/>
I was sure it would prove very welcome newes
<newline/>
unto her Ma
<super id="0120" replace="jestie">
tie
</super>
. That they were able of themselves
<newline/>
w
<super id="0383" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out her Hig
<super id="0124" replace="hnes">
nes
</super>
 assistance, to maintene there
<newline/>
owne estate. But howsoever 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count might
<newline/>
have uttered this to him, I did not thinke that
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e states would cunne him any thankes, for any
<newline/>
suche discourse. And as for me I requested, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at
<newline/>
he would certifie 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count, as much as I had
<newline/>
saied: w
<super id="0138" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 he promised he would. The
<newline/>
next day after he came unto me, and signified,
<newline/>
that having told 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Count, what talke I had
<newline/>
w
<super id="0149" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 him, he could not well remember, whether [it]
<newline/>
was to me, or to some other of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Councel, that he
<newline/>
had cast out suche a worde: but he did not
<newline/>
deme it, and yet he said it was but spoken in 
<newline/>
a sleight kinde of sort, and upon an incident
<newline/>
occasion, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he would not in no wise in-
<newline/>
teresse 
<image name="thorn"/>
e state in any suche assertion. Wher-
<newline/>
upon M
<super id="0166" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Buzenval was urgent upon me, to
<newline/>
lette it passe away in silence. Howbeit for

did assure him,
