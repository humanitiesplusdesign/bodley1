tofore, That his felowe Commissioners might have
<newline/>
a Pasport of 
<image name="thorn"/>

<newline/>
Howbeit his speeches were quicke in taxing

blie, for suffering those of

</place>
 and himself in

this place, to attend so long w
<super id="0693" replace="ith">
t
</super>
out an answear.
<newline/>
There was nothing in writing delivered by him, nor
<newline/>
yet any thing required. For they are doubtfull
<newline/>
what to doe, in regard of 
<image name="thorn"/>
e vulgar people, among
<newline/>
whome it is thought, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e copies spredde abroade
<newline/>
of suche Propositions, will produce no good effectes.
<newline/>
Nevertheles there are some men sette a worke about 
<newline/>
framing an answear: w
<super id="3617" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 will be negative all-
<newline/>
together, and yet contrived in suche sort, as both
<newline/>
it may contene

e reasons of their refusall, to
<newline/>
hearcken to those Ambassado
<super id="0710" replace="">

</super>
 and likewise their
<newline/>
desire, to come to a Pacification. Moreover, as
<newline/>
I suppose, they will resolve to send their answear,
<newline/>
not onely to 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Emperor but to divers Princes of
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e Empire, and also publishe it in print.
<newline/>
<newline/>
They are wholy buisied heere, about making pro-

will be ready w

<newline/>
<folioref id="0746">
fol.272v
</folioref>
 it will be needefull, in my opinion to attempt it
<newline/>
out of hand, and 
<image name="thorn"/>
at 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="3626" person_id="Navarre">
Kinge
</person>
 doe concurre and,
<newline/>
that very earnestly, in 
<image name="thorn"/>
e self same petition.
<newline/>
I have imparted it at large unto M
<super id="3591" replace="aster">
r
</super>
 Buzenval,
<newline/>
who embraced it presently, w
<super id="0760" replace="ith">
t
</super>
 a very good liking
<newline/>
but perceaving after, as I doe conjecture, that
<newline/>
it would not be pleasing to Count Maurice, to w
h
ome
<newline/>
he would not but be pleasing, I doe finde him a 
<newline/>
litle shrinking, and alleaging against it, That
<newline/>
<image name="thorn"/>
e King may receave as great 
<insertion id="0769">
a
</insertion>
 benefit, by the
<newline/>
exploites of these contreis, as by 
<image name="thorn"/>
e use of those
<newline/>
men, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at they may spare him. But his arguments
<newline/>
are so feeble, as they rather seeme to be sought of
<newline/>
sette purpose, then presented unto him, upon good
<newline/>
discourse of reason. I should thinke it very
<newline/>
requisit, in respect of his backwardnes, that some
<newline/>
letter of charge from 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Kinge, or of advise from
<newline/>
<person id="3629" person_id="Nocle">

<super id="0783" replace="ieur">

<newline/>
<newline/>
It is commonly spoken heere, that 
<image name="thorn"/>
e mariage be-
<newline/>
tween Count Hohenloo and 
<image name="thorn"/>
e 
<person id="3632" person_id="Buren, M">
Countesse of Buren
</person>
<newline/>
Count Maurices sister, shal be shortly solemnised.
<newline/>
And many men imagine, it will occasion great
<newline/>
dissention between 
<image name="thorn"/>
e two Countes. For 
<image name="thorn"/>
e Coun-
<newline/>
tesse complaineth, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at her brother doth oppresse
<newline/>
her in sundrie great causes, whiche Count Ho-
<newline/>
henloo will not tolerat, if he were maried to
<newline/>
the Countesse, as he openly professeth. Moreo-
<newline/>
ver for these three or fower yeres, 
<image name="thorn"/>
e counte-
<newline/>
nance and cariage of Count Maurice towardes
<newline/>
him, hath rather bin unloving, and disdainfull,
<newline/>
and framed to depresse him, then respective to
<newline/>
his qualitie, to his merites towardes his father, and
<newline/>
<folioref id="0808">
fol.273r
</folioref>
 his former good services. Wherat Count Hohenloo
<newline/>
hath greatly grieved for a long time together: and
<newline/>
nowe, as it seemeth, by report of those speeches,
<newline/>
w
<super id="0814" replace="hich">
ch
</super>
 he uttereth to divers, he will take more know-
<newline/>
ledge of suche usage. It is surmised 
<image name="thorn"/>
at he hath
<newline/>
secret frindes in this state, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at are in good credit,
<newline/>
and encourage him to this course. I can not
<newline/>
yet conceave, 
<image name="thorn"/>
at this division between them, will
<newline/>
growe to 
<image name="thorn"/>
at degree, as to disturbe 
<image name="thorn"/>
